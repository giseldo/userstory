29494181,2020-01-10 19:20:50.351,Cache `node_modules` for www-gitlab-com pipelines,"# UPDATE NOTE: This MR will not be implemented.  After looking at the initial numbers, the amount of additional time taken by the additional cache push/pull (~18500 files in `node_modules`, about ~8 seconds to push and ~8 seconds to pull) would eat up most of the gains caused by eliminating the `yarn install` (which takes ~20 seconds).  This seems to indicate that the Yarn/NPM network download time is normally very fast (probably due to CDN/etc, and yarn optimizations), almost as fast as downloading and unzipping the files from disk.  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/6358 still offers opportunities to do this caching via docker, though.

We currently don't put the downloaded node_modules in the cache, like we do for the bundler vendor directory containing gems.  This would probably be an easy and quick win to save 20-30 seconds, and also reduce the possibility of flaky builds (if the download happens to fail for network/etc issues - I'm not sure if we are using a local pass-through caching proxy or not)

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Small, probably 20-30 seconds for jobs which need this.

PROS:
* Easy to implement, low risk, same as we are already doing for gems",1

- [x] Clicking on the ""Azure devops"" logo under the ""create"" column should link to `https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/azure-devops-vs-gitlab.html#create`
- [x] URL hashes should be manually navigable, ie typing in the URL manually links to that spot.

For now this will only apply to two rows: GitHub and Azure.

### Problem Statement:

```
via @tbarr

The GitHub and Azure DevOps logos link to this page: https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html or this page: https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/azure-devops-vs-gitlab.html

The logos in the Comparison chart should deep-link into the section that is relevant. For example, if you click on the GitHub logo under PACKAGE, it should take you to: https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html#package

There also seems to be a problem that even if you paste that link, it doesn't take you to package until you click.

* **Stand out CTA element** - Pick CTA to try (will impact KPIs)
* **Set KPIs** - Set MVC KPIs in order to test the positive and negative impacts of your change - especially marketing KPIs. For example, if changing other elements is required to fit the new CTA, how might that negatively impact other experiences and metrics?
* **Validate performance** If testing proves the MVC is positive change, share demonstrable data, merge, and implement health monitoring and reporting.

Looks related to the partial builds process, at least that's the test that's failing ( build_proxy_resource )

Yeah something to do with the data being pulled from greenhouse possibly. The job apply template appears to source its data through jobs_listing.rb which sources the data from the greenhouse_io gem

On another tangent, the job listing library hasn't been updated in 4 months so that's probably not the file responsible. The job page template hasn't been updated in weeks so I don't think that's it either.

Local development of this repo is slow and cumbersome. Production build times for Middleman are also slow. 

### Proposal

Let's move frontend asset builds out of Middleman and into an `external_pipeline`. This will allow Middleman to do what it does best - compile the HTML.

For our `external_pipeline`, lets have it complete the following tasks:
- preprocess scss
- minify css
- minify js
- bundle js
- sourcemaps
- copy web fonts, icons
- image resizing and processing* (depending on speed)
- browser reload (local dev)
 (local dev)

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

Faster local development for developers.

Faster deployment times. Reduced publishing time for blog, handbook, and marketing webpages. 

### Iterative Approach
1. Process Stylsheets with Webpack first, introducing build to system
1. Monitor and fix edgecases
1. Add javascript bundling to Webpack second
1. Monitor and fix egecases
1. Migrate rollup to Webpack for vue component bundles
1. Monitor and fix edgecases
1. Add image process to Webpack

Measure our speed to triage new issues. We currently have ~400 new issues every week in CE/EE. We need to go through all of them and identify valid issues and high severity bugs. 

## Measurement definition

The duration from issue creation to partial triage time for all gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks~2278648 issues in `gitlab-org/gitlab`. This will be visualized as a Time Series chart showing the average duration by month. 

Next steps:
- [x] Define an automated mechanism to detect first triage of a GitLab team member. - starting with description in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/136#note_211116724 
- [ ] Define measure mechanism and establish threshold.  
- [ ] Fan-out triaging to all of engineering. First triage is mostly on the Quality Dept Eng Prod team.
- [ ] Expand this into first scheduled milestone.

I had an idea. Do we need some kind of initiative like DigitalOcean seems to have for writing tutorial-style blog posts? Similar to https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-gitlab-on-ubuntu-18-04.

`How to install GitLab 11.9 with Geo on AWS` sounds attractive.

We can only do so much to make our docs apply generally *and* add cloud-provider-specific exceptions *and* keep them up-to-date. I'd like to avoid making our general docs more confusing with too much specificity. But without specificity, the sysadmin needs to learn how the whole system works.

Blog posts like this acknowledge this problem. They are hyper-specific. They go out-of-date, but the type of people installing GitLab should understand that, and should be able to adapt these tutorials to their purposes until a better one comes along that bumps the old one down the Google results.

Would a blog post resolve this issue?

### Problem to solve

Gitlab users want to easily find/read release notes relevant to them, such as tier, the stages they use or specific items of interest (upgrades, deprecations and removals) in release announcements. Gitlab team members (such as Marketing and Sales) want to successfully find/share relevant release notes with Gitlab users and prospects. 

The following pages deliver Gitlab's release notes organized in various ways, forcing internal and external Gitlab users to reference various pages to collect the information they seek:

- **Release Post Marketing Blog""**: https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/06/22/gitlab-13-1-released/
- **Gitlab Releases""** https://about.gitlab.com/releases/ archived ==> https://web.archive.org/web/20200714130736/https://about.gitlab.com/releases/
- **GitLab upcoming releases""** https://about.gitlab.com/upcoming-releases/
- **Upcoming features for paid tiers""** https://about.gitlab.com/direction/paid_tiers/
- **X-Y Preview""** https://about.gitlab.com/releases/gitlab-com/
- **Gitlab releases""** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases/v12.10.0-ee

### Intended users

Current users, prospects, internal Gitlab team members

### Proposal

Improve and leverage Gitlab's in product Release feature https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases to serve as the ""go to"" SSOT for both SaaS and Self-hosted release notes, such that it can essentially replace the need for the various pages listed above.

**Benefits**

- Deliver a better user release notes experience internally/externally
- Boost process efficiency by decoupling the requirements of ""release notes"" from a ""marketing blog post""
- Enable Product team to focus on feature/supporting content success 
- Enable Marketing to focus on how, when and where else to best expose the release notes as part
- Enable Sales to clearly communicate via one thorough/sortable SSOT for existing and potential customers

**Requirements:**

To successfully replace the various release pages listed above, the Release feature https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases needs to:

### Proposal

Versioned tests are listed as one of the highlighted features of GitLab CI/CD, but it doesn't look like we use that term or have fully explained what that looks like and what that means. I would like to make a post that talks about versioned tests and what they are, what they do, how to set them up, and why they're a good feature.

This is for the CI Use Case Campaign. Publish date is not time-sensitive, anytime in Q3 is fine.

#### What are the steps to reproduce the bug

From AaronFriel:

> If anyone from GitLab is reading this, these pages are locked in a refresh loop. I can't read the content because it is scrolling/moving slightly with every refresh which is happening constantly.
> Latest version of Chrome stable, uBlock Origin in default config, HTTPS Everywhere, React/Redux devtools are the extensions I have installed.
> 
> I let the page run for 30 seconds and:
> 
> * CPU usage on two cores was at 100%
> 
> * 2,943 requests were made for 319 MB of resources over 30.06 seconds
> 
> A staggering rate of 100 requests per second that persists indefinitely - I have no reason to believe the refresh loop is broken at any point.

From Earwig: 

> Same issue here as the original post and similar extensions. I followed the suggestion of clearing cookies for about.gitlab.com and it doesn't help.

### Goals
Increase Demo landing page conversion rate on about.gitlab.com with collaborative, data-driven MVC. The first attempt did not prove net positive, let's learn from that and try again.

### Audience
- Devs prospects new to gitlab at all stages of their careers.

### Requirements

Must Have

- Co-design an improved and compliant solution - Co-design a conversion-driven MVC that meets or exceeds the design and usability the current state solution. The MVC should be informed by conversion best practices, marketing strategy and brand and website standards. Consider page speed, content and form optimization.
- Set KPIs - Set MVC KPIs in order to test the positive and negative impacts of your change - especially marketing KPIs. How might your changes negatively affect experiences and metrics?
- Validate performance If testing proves the MVC is positive change, share demonstrable data, merge, and ensure health monitoring and reporting.
- Share change events - Document and share change events and results with relevant GitLab teams.
- Should Have

Could Have

Wont Have

- Non-cohesive demo experience - Ensure the new landing page experience is aligned to the overall demo workflow (i.e. continuous content and design experience).

### KPIs


### Proposed Tasks
- Conversion audit & recommendations (Shane)
- KPI's
- Planning
- MVC Requirements
- Iterative Co-Design
- Build the page @skarpeles
- Test
- If success: Merge, monitor and report

As the monthly blog post gets longer (more teams shipping more items) it is challenging for users to find what they need.  Consider adding an option to the UI for users to sort by section (key features, other features, deprecations, etc) as well as sorting by plan type and/or stage. The default of the page would be to show everything as we now do, but then the user can sort/filter as needed.

This is not the correct repository for requests related to docs.gitlab.com, the GitLab product, or other items.

For information regarding working on the about website please visit the [Brand and Digital Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-digital-design/)

You may link to this issue template using the following URL: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/new?issuable_template=-website-work-request

-->

#### Briefly describe the request


The names of our DevOps stages It would sticky while scrolling over that stage's features

For example:  `Manage` should remain visible while scrolling over the feature subsections `Users`, `DevOps Reports` and `Value Stream Management` (each a `<h4 class=""text-left""`), or when jumping through all `LDAP` mentions with Ctrl+F.

#### What is/are the relevant URL(s)

https://about.gitlab.com/features/

#### What team/dept/company initiatives does this relate to?

<!--
Examples:
* Brand and Digital wants to improve growth metrics via [tactical conversion MVCs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/242).
* [OKR FY 21 Q1 CMO: 20% increase in inbound MQLs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/fy21-q1/)
-->

#### Is there a due date? If so, why?

No.

#### What problem(s) are we trying to solve? What are the goals?

<!--
Please specify which goal is the primary goal.
Examples:
* (Primary) Increase self-hosted conversion rate.
* Users can't find what they're looking for.
* It's difficult to sign up.
* This feature is confusing.
* This template is difficult to update.
* Reduce cognitive overload.
* Improve time-on-site.
-->

The lifecycle stage headings on [/features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) (`<a class=""item-link"" ... <h2>` plus maybe `<p class=""subhead""> ...`) can be a long distance apart from where one views the page. This necessitates a lot of scrolling up (often too far, therefore down again) to find the stage name.

#### Who is the audience?

<!--
Please specify which audience is the primary audience.
Examples:
* (Primary) Potential event attendees.
* Speakers
* Media
* Potential sponsors
-->

* GitLab employees looking up the feature-to-stage assignment, for example to then find out a DRI, stable support counterpart or technical writer on [/company/team/org-chart](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/org-chart/) or [/handbook/product/categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).

#### What are the measurable key performance indicators (KPI)?

See examples in `checklist of deliverables` below.

#### Please identify the directly responsible individual (DRI), stakeholders, and roles

<!--
Who should we be asking for questions and reviews?
Example in a markdown table:

|Name|Role|
|------|------|
| `@user1` | DRI |
| `@user2` | Conversion |
| `@user3` | Design |
| `@user4` | Metrics |

etc
-->

#### What are the project must-haves?

The `<h2>` stage header must remain in view while scrolling.

#### What are the project should-haves?

Maybe pinned to the to the top of its respective `<div class=""features-description`, below `<header class=""navbar""`.

<!--
These are important but not necessary for delivery in the current timebox. These are often not as time-critical and may be delayed until a later milestone.

(Example should-haves)
* New look & feel
* Improved navigation
* Updated hero section
-->

#### What are the project could-haves?

Instead of pin to top, maybe to the side, tilted by 90˚?

<!--
These are desirable but not necessary.

(Example could-haves)
* Sliders
* Animations
* ""Bells-and-whistles""
-->

#### What are the project wont-haves?

<!--
These are not planned at this time.

(Example wont-haves)
* A certain section of the page is currently performing well or functioning as intended. Do not change it.
* A requested feature is too expensive and not currently a good way to spend limited resources.
* A requested feature is impossible given current constraints and existing technology.
-->

#### Where do you expect traffic to come from?

<!--
Examples:
* Linked from https://about.gitlab.com/example/
* Social media campaign
* Targeted ads
-->

#### Please provide any related media files

<!--
If you are requesting that we place images, videos, etc on a page, please either attach the files to the issue or tell us where they can be sourced:
* What subject matter of imagery or videos are you looking for?
    * Examples: Stock photo of a young person using a phone, screenshot of application name during stage/interaction/screen X, abstract tech background...
* The @username of who has related files, what issue they're in, or where they can be found.
* For logos, please upload vector files such as svg if possible. If vector files are not possible, please upload transparent png.
* If linking a word/spreadsheet/presentation document with images included, please also provide links to the original image sources.
* Please note that the more media we have to spend time sourcing, re-sizing, and touching up, the less time we have to work on other items. Media is important but don't forget to weigh its implementation costs.

#### Will you need an opengraph image for social sharing?

<!--
Yes or no, and what could it look like?
-->

#### If applicable, please provide some example webpages for design guidance.

<!--
Please specify why you like each reference.
Examples:

<!--
Examples:
* Google docs/sheets, Figma prototypes, Mural diagrams.

- [ ] Approved review of changes
- [ ] Implement AB test (for example: compare clickthrough rate for `/stages-devops-lifecycle/...` pages vs. each stage's features' docu pages)

I have quite a few screenshots of different old versions of GitLab. When I show it to some GitLab people, they were excited about it. One person suggested I make a blog post out of it. 

This can be a single blog post or series. With few screenshots per-year and some little text. Or more extended version. Right now its a raw idea. I don't have a good plan yet. Want to check out what people think.

32704197,2020-03-31 22:40:02.760,2020Q2 update website issue templates and documentation,"### Broad goals

* Communicate how to work with the marketing Brand and Digital team.
* Improve the quality of issues received in the www-gitlab-com repository.

### Pain points

* ""How do I create a website request?""
* ""Which template do I use for what?""
* Documents are TLDR.

### Specific goals, default issue template

* People aren't reading. Replace this copy with a simple ""Please select a template from above. Issues without a template are unlikely to be prioritized""
* Link to B&D as the repository DRI.
* Each template should describe it's use, first thing.
* Improve clarity of template titles (""be as explicit as possible"").
* Consolidate templates & reduce choice overload.

### Specific goals, other issue templates

* Add more sections...
    * What are the pain points?
    * What company or team goals/initiatives does this align with?
    * **What are the deliverables?**
        * Explore the use of checklists, particularly in the case of deliverables.
    * **Directly ask for MOSCOW** instead of indirectly asking...
        * What are the must-haves?
        * What are the should-haves?
        * What are the could-haves?
        * What are the wont-haves?
* Consolidate templates & reduce choice overload.
    * Streamline templates based on organic changes made over time via observation, similar to examples:
        * Issue description in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/6294)
        * ""Deliverables"" comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/1596#note_274860052)
* Add more information and requirements around due-dates.
    * Emphasize the use of phases and MVC.
* Add section for requesting opengraph images so this isn't an afterthought.
* Consider hiding titles and examples behind comments so that they aren't visible when someone forgets to delete sections.
* People often aren't reading. Consider limiting details.
    * Remove sections which aren't commonly used or at the very least move them towards the bottom of the issue template.
    * Similarly move the most used sections towards the top.
* Make labels as automated as possible.
    * Only require the most necessary labels, others can be added during grooming.
* Reassess which parts should be opt-in vs opt-out.
    * switch cc pings @ gl-website from opt-out to opt-in.
    * switch from ""manually add labels"" to opt-out of labels.
* Add breadcrumbs such as ""if you require any redesign to this page, you're using the wrong template. Please use X instead [link].""
* Consider adding collapsible sections.
* Add a label identifying which template was used. Certain templates already have this, many do not. This will help provide metrics around use.

### Deliverables

- [x] Updated default issue template.
- [x] Updated individual issue templates.
- [x] Search documentation for links to old templates and replace with new links.

Related [Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/854)

@jennyt has requested the following:

#### What is/are the expected URL(s)

* /events/virtual-devops-workshops

#### Briefly describe the page/flow

1. A landing page that we can send people to for display and selection of virtual workshops. The actual workshops will be on separately created Marketo landing pages.

#### If applicable, do you have any user journeys, wireframes, prototypes, content/data?

The last time we did something similar was for the 2019 Roadshow https://about.gitlab.com/events/roadshow-2019/

**MVC:**

1. Add an agenda table in place of the speaker section (right side column). <-- `Currently the only item remaining on the request!` This is MVC because the page is text heavy and needs something (image, table) to break it up.
2. Clone the 2019 Roadshow page, rephrase to virtual devops workshops. (jenny did this in the MR)
3. Create a new data/event_virtual_devops_workshop.yml file to populate the data. (brandon did this)

**Ideally:**

1. The event selection at the bottom of the page will be on one line across the screen (to prevent scrolling) instead of vertical.
2. Remove the speaker section from this page. (jenny did this in the MR)
3. Add a ""who should attend"" section. (jenny did this in the MR)
4. Implementing the functionality to automatically pull relevant events onto this page when the individual pages are created. (brandon did this)


**Long term:** Brandon recommends we adapt the new event template created recently in the following issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/6294, remove irrelevant sections, and add a new component for listing the virtual workshops.

#### What is the primary purpose of this page/flow?

Generate registrations for virtual workshops

#### What are the KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

Registration counts

#### What information is this page/flow trying to convey?

* Existence of virtual workshops
* Agenda
* Who should attend

### Who is the primary audience? Be specific.

* [x] Potential Prospects who have never heard about GitLab
* [x] Prospects we're currently selling to
* [ ] Non-paying customers
* [x] Paying customers
* [ ] Authorized resellers
* [ ] Community members

This workshop is designed for IT Professionals:

* Actively evaluating GitLab for their organization
* Driving innovation by knowing the full scope of the GitLab tool chain
* Planning to increase operations

#### Any other audiences?

No

#### Where do you expect traffic to come from?

Marketing emails to database, sales-invited

#### Does this page/flow require any forms

Yes. @jennyt will assist in providing the relevant registration form.  Registration form will be on the individual landing pages for each event.  

#### Is there a due date? If so, why?

Please note that issues with a short deadline and no listed reasons are difficult to prioritize.

**2020-03-27**, reasons unknown, deadline already passed.

Reason for deadline: The time to set-up and promote a webcast or virtual event is a minimum of 45 days. This event was provided to the MPM team after this deadline. We are able to promote and fill the event, but we require the landing page as quickly as possible. Once the single page is set up with the functionality to pull the individual registration page links, we will not need to repeat this work.

## Requested deliverables

* Switch the main nav so it doesn't have the free-trial CTA (free trial is distracting).
    * The thank you popup after submit could have free-trial as secondary CTA.
    * Make sure there is only one CTA.
        * Remove the ""ready to talk"" section at the bottom of the page.
* Change the download CTA phrase from ""Read the Whitepaper"" to ""Get your Whitepaper"".
    * Suggested copy: any action word that doesn't sound like work (ie not ""read"")
* Try different report screenshots or potentially animations, have a more graphical cover.
    * Ask Luke for suggestions, we could create a cover, perhaps some synergy of the graphic with the CTA button.
* Try moving the bullet points into the purple section before the CTA button (what you will learn is important).
* Change the popup title to match the button (Get your whitepaper).
* Bump up the font size of and adjust copy to ""trusted by 100,000+ organizations worldwide"" and make it bigger.
* Check with @ mnguyen4 to ensure copy is consistent with what interested them in the first place.

- [ ] Identify [type of poll](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011624547-Creating-Your-First-Poll).
- [ ] Identify questions for poll.
- [ ] Identify pages where the poll will or won't be served.
- [ ] Identify where the poll will live on the page for desktop/tablet/mobile.
- [ ] Implement the form.
- [ ] Create a followup issue to identify next steps (what do we do with the info gathered, what other polls should we make, create documentation, create an issue template for requesting polls, etc...)

## Proposal

<!-- What do you want to blog about? Add your description here. If you are making an announcement, please open an `announcement` request issue in the Corporate Marketing project instead: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements -->

The [digital experience team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/digital-experience/) recently launched the [new Slippers blog template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/-/issues/1146) for the marketing blog. 

I have two main points I'd like to write about, and I'd be happy to take feedback on which direction to pursue, or if it makes sense to write two separate posts, or if one post could contain both points.

1. We used GitLab's [iteration value](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration), along with GitLab's tool to [promote an issue to an epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#promote-an-issue-to-an-epic) to iterate on an issue we realized was too large in scope by [promoting it to the blog post template epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/-/epics/296). Once we did this, we were able to also [collaborate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration) more effectively. I'd like to highlight how GitLab's iteration and collaboration values are embodied by the GitLab product's technical capabilities.
1. We had a problem where existing CSS was conflicting with the Slippers design system, and since we didn't have the header/footer ready yet, we couldn't just disable them all. So we used the [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to encapsulate CSS entirely, along with [templates and slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots) to write semantic HTML in erb or HAML templates as desired, all tied together with [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements). In addition to the values piece, I'd like to showcase how we used Web Components to solve challenges in a way that allowed us to iterate quickly. We have lots of the content [written as documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/0c3b195ee49d4283fcb8330f987b3c039d0f2cff/doc/slippers-blog-template.md#L22), which could be rewritten in an approachable way for the blog.

## Proposal

When of the major shortcomings of accessibility in software development is that it is something tacked on at the end of the software development lifecycle. By shifting accessibility left, as in, thinking about building accessible software at the first stage of the SDLC, can be a game-changer for accessible software development. This blog post talks about what accessible software development looks like and how companies like GitLab – a product built for developers, by developers, to help developers build better software – can look like.

Our first blog post about YAML tricks to speed up pipelines was so popular we're thinking of doing a follow-up post that explores different tips for developers on how to use YAML for CI/CD. @cbuchanan @dnsmichi do you have any ideas for team members who might know a lot about this topic that can write a blog post or can be interviewed?

Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. -->

## Triage (REQUIRED)

The Inbound Marketing team prioritizes requests that drive results and meet our [goals of generating organic traffic and inquiries](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#goals). 

Please note that there is a different process for when you want to announce something via the blog. Please see [announcement requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements) in the handbook and open an announcement request issue instead of a blog post issue. 

Generally speaking, engineering blog posts that are tutorials/how-tos or which share how we built or debugged something, are popular with our audience. **If your proposed blog post is aligned with our [Attributes of a successful blog post guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#attributes-of-a-successful-blog-post), you can skip straight to your [proposal](#proposal).** 

If you are pitching something outside of those guidelines, please fill in the below to help us prioritize. You can check out [examples of high- and low-performing blog posts to help with your rationale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/content/editorial-team/#top-performing-blog-posts). 

**This issue fulfills one of these goals:** <!--(Requestor check one)-->
- [ ] Drive traffic to our website
- [ ] Convert traffic into leads
- [ ] Thought leadership/share expertise
- [ ] Build relationships with potential customers
- [ ] Drive long-term results (please explain below in your proposal)

#### What is/are the relevant URL(s)

`https://about.gitlab.com/events/`

#### Briefly describe the bug

The Event list sorting does not always work correctly for events where the date is a date range.

In development, you need to be running the marketing site (not the handbook) to view the `/events` page.

#### If possible, please specify how to reproduce the bug

In `events.yml` define an event with `date:` as a range.

`date: December 30 - January 4, 2021`

or 

`date: December 30 - January 4, 2022`

or 

`date: December 30 - December 31, 1999`

In all cases GitLab::Homepage::Event `sort_date` will parse `December 30` as `December 30, 2021` (the current year).

Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. -->

### Proposal

Part of our [engineering + remote work series/collection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/global-content/editorial/-/issues/57#note_444393598), how we do agile and sprints remotely. Will add any relevant videos to the issue in description/comments.

### Questions for respondents 

* How does GitLab (the platform) enable teams to work more agilely? ([Here is a blog post we published on the topic](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/), but I'd like to know your perspective as well)
* How does your team specifically use sprints at GitLab?
* Do you have experience working with Agile for software development while working in an office setting, at a previous company?
* Do you feel that GitLab's structure as an all-remote async company makes it easier for programmers to work agilely? Why or why not?
* Thinking specifically about Agile/sprints, what are some of the benefits of working in an office setting, with your colleagues next to you? What are some of the challenges?
* Are there any major differences between conducting a sprint/Agile software development on an in-person team vs. an all-remote, asynchronous team?
* What are some tools, strategies that are most useful for remote, Agile software development? Any links/resources I should include in this post?
* What advice do you have for engineers that are adopting Agile for the first time, or are working remotely for the first time?
* What else do I need to know but haven't asked?

We have a ton of documentation around making the migration process from Jenkins easier - let's talk about that. Found this product direction [here](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/jenkins_importer/) and think it could be worth talking about.

We could make this specific to how we're improving the migration process from Jenkins and use it for the Jenkins competitive campaign relaunch. Would like to see your thoughts on this.

* [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/8bxbyw/why_do_you_want_to_migrate_from_jenkins/) asking why you want to migrate from Jenkins

## [How to find the right CI/CD solution](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/15/finding-the-right-ci-cd/)

This can be some helpful content that isn't GitLab-focused, and provides some good action steps that would fit into the CI topic page.

### Proposal

Sid: I propose I write an article headlined: How Kamil created the DevOps platform software category from Poland. It will first talk about the Gartner validation including ""Our definition of VSDP does not describe a system that cobbles together disparate DevOps tools. Instead, we view VSDPs as integrated platforms that enhance productivity, collaboration, communication, and business outcomes for product teams via interactions between the platform
components."" Then, how Kamil advocated for integrating GitLab SCM with CI in 2016.

71699493,2020-09-25 17:08:38.652,Links to blog posts from review app wrong for file names with uppercase letters,"Blog post urls are automatically downcased during the build. This is good because mixed case URLs are bad for SEO. 

However, when a review app links directly to blog post with a mixed case file name, it returns a error. This is because the review app link doesn't change the URL link to all downcase.

For example, a blog post file name of `2020-09-30-Q3-hackathon-recap.html.md.erb`  will directly link to this URL from the review app this https://hackathon-recap.about.gitlab-review.app/blog/2020/09/30/Q3-hackathon-recap/index.html.

That will return an ""no file found"" xml error because the of the mixed casing. The correct and reachable URL is https://hackathon-recap.about.gitlab-review.app/blog/2020/09/30/q3-hackathon-recap/index.html

70091116,2020-08-21 01:48:34.513,Add a visual element on Handbook pages to differentiate it from Marketing pages,"### Proposal
Add a visual element on the Handbook pages to help differentiate it from Marketing pages. 

### What problem is this solving?
At the moment we have enabled editing with the static site editor on Handbook pages. However some marketing pages look like Handbook pages and it is confusing users why they can't use the static site editor.

An example of this is with the Direction page (https://about.gitlab.com/direction/)

One approach to solving this problem is moving the content to the Handbook. This approach may take a while to coordinate across teams so we are considering a smaller more immediate change on the Handbook side to help users quickly recognise that they are on the Handbook.

| Handbook Page | Non-handbook Page |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![CleanShot_2020-08-21_at_08.43.45_2x](/uploads/4b4be81909dd742fefbdb97e242d257c/CleanShot_2020-08-21_at_08.43.45_2x.png) | ![CleanShot_2020-08-21_at_08.43.32_2x](/uploads/7ed331fff28e3f1f6e753ca7777a65bc/CleanShot_2020-08-21_at_08.43.32_2x.png) |

_example of two pages looking very similar, however, are in different areas of the site_

### Suggestion
We are considering changing the background image of the header area of the Handbook.

This would be an extension of what we are already doing with the favicon in the browser for Handbook page

This issue tracks the effort to document how to investigate drops in the [error budget](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-detail-release/stage-groups-release-group-error-budget-detail?orgId=1).

The aim here is ensure new joiners and other engineers can follow a clear process to investigate such issues moving forward.

### Proposal

- Add a new section in the [Release Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/release) handbook page.
- Under the new section, document the steps one could follow to investigate issues with the [error budget](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-detail-release/stage-groups-release-group-error-budget-detail?orgId=1).",1

One of the exit criteria for [ClickHouse Working group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/clickhouse-datastore/#exit-criteria) states

> Consider an abstraction layer to interaction with ClickHouse or alternatives

With motivation behind it being the fact that ClickHouse requires significant resources to be run, and for smaller installations of GitLab it might not return investment with provided performance improvement. That in result creates a risk that ClickHouse might not be globally available for all installations and all features would need to account for the fact that there might be different data stores available. In order to avoid placing burned of detecting and handling multiple data stores on each feature implementation an abstraction layer is considered that will abstract specific data store from feature code

## Goal

Build prof of concept prototype that would follow outlined later exercise scenario and provide summary that is going to rate prospect solution agains following criteria:

1. Can all requirements from exercise scenario be completed: (Yes/No)
1. Can database engine specific functions like ([percentile_disc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-aggregate.html)) being used: (Yes/No/After additional work):
1. Measure execution time for each of the exercise scenarios
1. Have you encountered any performance issues and/or excessive hardware resources consumption
 
On scale 1 to 5 (1 - very easy, 5 - very hard):
1. How complex was to write request to realise outlined scenarios
1. How complex would be to configure add new table to each of the engines
1. How complex would be to apply changes to schema of each relations described in the exercise scenario section

## Exercise scenario

Proof of concept prototype with [cube.dev](https://cube.dev/docs/getting-started/docker) must retrieve following information for each of data engines:

1. Total number of clients for each country  
1. Get 75 [percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) for total price of orders
2. Find `order_id` of the order that have the biggest total price

Data engines schema details are: 

### PostgreSQL

1. Create 4 tables `Clients (id, name, country)`, `Orders(id, client_id, created_at)`, `LineItems(id, item_id, order_id, created_at)` and  `Items(id, name, created_at, price)` 
2. Seed tables with 100 clients records
3. Seed 100 items records
4. Seed 1000 000 orders, where 250000 orders contain 1 line item, 250000 orders contain 2 lines items, 250000 orders contain 3 lines items, and finally 250000 orders contain 4 lines items

# Clickhouse

1. Create single table `LineItemAddToOrderEvent(id, client_name, client_country, order_id, item_name, item_price, created_at)`
2. Seed it with 2 500 000 rows",5

We currently update the `pps_*` values in `features.yml` in order to populate the [Features by Theme page](https://about.gitlab.com/features/by-theme/).

We should discontinue maintaining those values and instead direct the audience to the [PPS Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-dashboard/1007759/PPS-Dashboard).

## What was the initial objective?

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/66574 created `features/by-theme` in order to create:

> a page that represents the key features by capability and cleanups some of the listed features for those capabilities. The cleanup mostly involved removing features that seemed duplicative when listed alongside others in the same capability.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/84577 added the PPS data to the page ...

But there isn't any additional context on the intent in the MR. 

## Are we achieving the objective?

I'm not sure, but updating the pps values to populate that page is an inefficient, time-consuming process.

Now that all of the PPS data is available in Sisense we should utilize it as the primary destination for this type of data.

If grouping the results by pricing theme is valuable to team members, we could explore a way to provide that visualization in Sisense.

## Proposal

1. Remove the PPS values from the table and return the page to its initial design:

![image](/uploads/900302d80812eba8a6ffba625d71c6be/image.png)

_Wayback machine_

2. Add a link to the page pointing visitors to the PPS Dashboard if they are looking for PPS data for a given feature.

3. Optionally, delete the page entirely if ""Features by Theme"" is no longer used by team members in strategic decision making.

Is there an audience for this page?

The page had 711 visits in calendar year 2022. 509 if you remove that strange spike at the end of August.

118681487,2022-11-14 15:28:10.712,Feature Flag training for Aaron Huntsman - Q32022,"# Feature Flag And Monitoring Training

[Feature Flags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/) are used by GitLab engineers in order to roll out changes while
monitoring the impact.

They are **not the same** as the [**Operations > Feature Flag**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html) feature inside of GitLab.

This template is intended to help understand
how and when to use this tool in development.
 
Currently as part of the feature flag process [there is an expectation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#process) that GitLab engineers will monitor their changes with our monitoring tools. 

When the changes are low risk and do not require the [change management process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process) the expectation is that the engineer conducting the rollout will monitor their change themselves. This training is also designed to allow GitLab engineers to become aware of and comfortable with the [monitoring](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/) that is provided by the [Infrastructure department](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/).

Regardless of risk assessment, **it is expected that the engineer responsible will follow up with the change in production when the flag is flipped**.

Doing so can lower the likelihood of a production issue and if a production issue does occur we can lower the time they last and impact they have.

**Notes**:

As we increase the use of feature flags, engineers have an opportunity/expectation to use our monitoring that they did not have previously.

The [DORA research program](http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/dora_research_program.pdf) specifically calls out observability and monitoring as being one of 38 key factors driving effective continuous delivery.

The more comfortable we are using the monitoring and observability tools for our systems, the better our outcomes will be in terms of mean-time-to-recovery, individual contributor awareness of infrastructure and scalability concerns, usage of infrastructure engineers' time, and teams' psychological safety.",1

117339418,2022-10-21 18:37:06.534,Update deprecation and removal content guidelines,"## Problem

Right now, we're often treating deprecations like notifications of an incoming removal. But users see a deprecation as a warning that you need to take action, to prevent a breaking change in the future. It's a subtle difference, but important. When they see a deprecation announcement, they expect to be able to do something immediately.

([Original source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13399#deprecations-should-be-actionable))

## Proposed solution

We should make it a requirement that all deprecations are actionable. [This list of Stripe's API changes](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-versions) shows the kind of implementation we should strive for.

Key terms to take note of: `deprecated in favor of`, `removed in favor of`, `use YYY instead`, etc. It is clearly explained what people need to do for each item.

Examples:

* We have removed tax_percent from objects and requests in favor of tax rates.
* Deprecate the payment_method.card_automatically_updated webhook in favor of payment_method.automatically_updated.
* Checkout Sessions no longer include the display_items property. Use the includable line_items property instead.

Then our requirement that breaking changes be announced at least 2-3 milestones before the major milestone means:

* We're *not* giving users 2-3 milestones to *prepare* for the change. We're giving them time to **make** the change.
* It isn't good enough to just make an announcement, we must have the deprecation *action* available at least 2-3 milestones before the breaking change as well. In fact, the deprecation process could be essentially: ""Step 1, prepare the replacement, step 2, create the deprecation, Step 3...""

### What is the Action when a replacement isn't provided?

The action would be ""Discontinue use of this feature by X.Y.""

### An example that we should try to avoid would be:

* Deprecation: Feature A is being removed, to be replaced with a future feature. Action: Wait for the future feature, and switch to it when it becomes available.

In this case, the deprecation should be delayed until the replacement is available.

We would like to request some ideas on how to increase the number of MVP nominations we receive on a monthly basis. It's an important component of the release post that gives us a chance to live out our values of Collaboration and Inclusion, but with each milestone, we receive very few nominations and the same contributors are nominated again and again.

## Current process

1. An MVP nomination issue is generated for each release post cycle: [15.2 example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13658)
1. The [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/release-post-mvp-nominations.md) mentions `@gl-product @gitlab-org/coaches @gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations` in order to increase awareness amongst relevant teams
1. The release post manager solicits nominations on the 7th and 12th by sharing a link to the nomination issue in the following Slack channels `#release-post, #community-relations, #mr-coaching #core`
1. The release post manager makes a selection from the nominations on the 15th, or escalates the lack of a nominee in those same channels

110263706,2022-06-16 22:18:46.285,Application metrics mvc/poc,"### What

The intention is to build out a minimal viable product or proof of concept for application metrics within the GitLab project. Artifacts from this effort should be:

- Application metric sent to Prometheus (think code block timing)
- Dashboard showing this metric build on prometheus (aggregated like averages/P95/other?)
- Playbook for other teams showing how to product application metrics and dashboards

The intention is to provide team members with metrics that enable them to performance tune their code.

### Why

Metrics is one component of our tooling that will enable team member efficiency, reduce chances for customer visible outages, and help avoid security and other bugs. More information on this effort can be found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13521

### When

The minimal viable product or proof of concept will ideally be complete before the end of the quarter.

### Questions

107154835,2022-04-25 17:48:01.528,Reduce the frequency of trainee maintainers in Reviewer Roulette,"From the [2022-04-25 Maintainership working group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RuWhO2q7rsgSKrnSCf2xsOrp56SXBHe_z5XKDls5px8/edit#) we discussed that maintainers and trainees sometimes take their busy indicator off, and immediately get several reviews. Because trainee maintainers get 3 times the amount of a regular reviewer (so that they get more experience), this can be even more overwhelming. We should consider reducing this.


### Context

Initially, [trainees were weighted higher](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/60035) at 3x as a trial but it does not look like we ever followed up. At the time, this would have meant a trainee maintainer gets picked 3/39 of the time.

Today, [Roulette works by](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-dangerfiles/blob/master/lib/danger/plugins/roulette.rb#L147) creating a list of reviewers, traintainers, and maintainers. Since traintainers _are_ reviewers, this means they are added to the list 4x [(3x for being a traintainer and 1 more time for being a reviewer)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13298#note_924545182). 

Does this still make sense?

### Data

Here is a brief sample of preliminary data:

For frontend:
- 25 maintainers
- 11 trainee maintainers
- 21 reviewers (10 non-trainees)
- Chances of a regular reviewer getting picked: 1/21 or 4% of the time
- Chances of a trainee maintainer getting picked: 4/21 or 19% of the time
- Chances of a maintainer getting picked: 1/25 or 4% of the time

For backend:
- 44 maintainers
- 19 trainee maintainers
- 55 reviewers (36 non-trainees)
- Chances of a regular reviewer getting picked: 1/55 or 2% of the time
- Chances of a trainee maintainer getting picked: 4/55 or 7% of the time
- Chances of a maintainer getting picked: 1/44 or 2% of the time

For database:
- 9 maintainers
- 5 trainee maintainers
- 19 reviewers (14 non-trainees)
- Chances of a regular reviewer getting picked: 1/19 or 5% of the time
- Chances of a trainee maintainer getting picked: 4/19 or 21% of the time
- Chances of a maintainer getting picked: 1/9 or 11% of the time

108502762,2022-03-15 04:38:11.673,Proposal: Improve deprecation/removal documentation and process,"Prod Ops release notes DRI is on board with the general direction of this proposal. Please see [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13399#note_1135324831) for more details. 

## Proposals

### Change from separate deprecation/removal pages to ""Important changes in GitLab XX"" pages.

The current pages are too big, and the lists will grow forever, so we should have pages for each
major version and all minor versions until the next major version. So one page for GitLab 14,
one for GitLab 15, and so on.

Most breaking changes happen in the major milestone, so if the new pages are sorted by milestone,
starting with XX.0, the breaking changes will be near the top of the page.

### Only use ""deprecation""/""removal"" terminology if it's truly a deprecation or a removal.

The documentation should be flexible enough that a PM/EM can write the exact information
that users need to know, without needing to massage the language to fit the ""deprecation -> removal""
concept.

We could:

- Just ensure it's clear that these notifications can use whatever language is needed to match the change
- Document a stricter third style for non-deprecation/removal content (with examples).
- Have a completely separate place for ""notable changes"".

Example important changes that might need to be explained differently than deprecations/removals.

- Feature flag status changes.
- Limit additions/changes.
- Changes to a feature, like where it is in the UI, the tier changing, etc.
- API/GraphQL changes might warrant different language as well, or even a different page as these are very common but clutter the pages. Perhaps one page for REST deprecations/changes, one for GraphQL?
- Feature that are no longer recommended, or perhaps no longer being developed, but not yet deprecated. ""Feature A is no longer in development, but current users can continue using it and receiving support.""

`@brhea` pointed out how Ruby handles this by noting everything that isn't a deprecation or a removal under ""Notable changes"" for each release. For example: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/6_0_release_notes.html#active-support

### Deprecations should be actionable

This is a suggestion to improve the deprecation process itself.

Right now, we're often treating deprecations like notifications of an incoming removal.
But users see a deprecation as a warning that you need to take action, to prevent
a breaking change in the future. It's a subtle difference, but important.
When they see a deprecation announcement, they expect to be able to do something immediately.

We should make it a requirement that all deprecations are fully actionable. Some
examples:

- Deprecation: `types` keyword being removed from CI/CD configuration.  
  Action: Start using the `stages` keyword, which already exists.
- Deprecation: Certificate-based Kubernetes integration being removed from GitLab.  
  Action: Start using the Agent for Kubernetes (already exists).
- Deprecation: Pseudonymizer feature is being removed from GitLab, with no replacement.  
  Action: Stop using Pseudonymizer.

Then our requirement that breaking changes be announced at least 2-3 milestones
before the major milestone means:

- We're _not_ giving users 2-3 milestones to _prepare_ for the change. We're giving them
  time to **make** the change.
- It isn't good enough to just make an annoucement, we must have the deprecation
  _action_ available at least 2-3 milestones before the breaking change as well.
  In fact, the deprecation process could be essentially: ""Step 1, prepare the replacement,
  step 2, create the deprecation, Step 3...""

An example that we should try to avoid would be:

- Deprecation: Feature A is being removed, to be replaced with a future feature.
  Action: Wait for the future feature, and switch to it when it becomes available.

In this case, the deprecation should be delayed until the replacement is available.

### Non-deprecation breaking changes

We also need to think about the language for non-deprecation breaking changes,
as well as the action users should take. For example:

- A feature being moved to Ultimate-only shouldn't be considered a deprecation,
  but is a breaking change that should be announced early. The action would be to upgrade to Ultimate,
  or stop using the feature. We can document examples of several kinds of announcement styles.
- A new limit being added, especially to .com, isn't a deprecation, but would require action. Like
  ""The maximum numbers of jobs in a pipeline will be set to 1234"". The action would
  then be to bring the project within the limit range before it is added.

<details>
<summary>Click me to expand/collapse.</summary>

As we've come closer and closer to 15.0, we've increasingly seen problems with the deprecation/removal notification process.

Currently, the process is to ""deprecate"" and notify users at least 2 releases before we then ""remove"" and notify users of the removal. Deprecations and removals can be considered Breaking Changes, or not.

But this somewhat simple process is not flexible enough for the variety of important changes that we implement each month, and repeated complaints seem to highlight this.

- Quotes from the thread in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/84339#note_901244690:
  - `That is not what deprecation notices are for. They mean ""Check for a replacement NOW, so you don't have issues later.""`
  - `It's a different story for ""we are just dropping this without replacement, stop using it"" deprecations.`
  - `The ""deprecated"" makes it sound like you should not use it anymore, which is why people are concerned about a lack of replacement.`
- From: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82646#note_874257859
  - `it seems like we're experiencing some scope creep as to what qualifies as a deprecation/removal. I've also been asked by other PMs to add things to the deprecation/removal doc that aren't deprecations or removals. To my knowledge, the deprecations/removals doc isn't for breaking changes that aren't caused by feature deprecations/removals.`
- From: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13230#note_923349881
  - (Paraphrasing) A breaking change notice was late because it was neither a deprecation nor a removal, and it was not intuitive that it should be added to either page.
- etc...

## Expanding on the issues

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes can come from all types of changes, including:

- Removals
- Limits (New/changed)
- Feature flag default state changes.
- Feature defaults changing from to on/off (or off/on).
- Feature changing tiers.
- Any other change in behavior that forces a user to take action before they can continue to work as normal.

It's notable that the only page that exists for these breaking changes is the removals page. I'm not considering the deprecations page for this, because a deprecation itself is not actually a breaking change (though it may warn of a future breaking change).

### Deprecations:

People generally expect deprecation warnings to mean: ""Stop doing X"" (often combined with a ""Start doing Y instead""). But our deprecation announcements are rarely that clear or simple, and the variability is huge:

- Sometimes immediately actionable:
  - ""The `types` keyword is deprecated, start using the `stages` keyword"".
  - ""The X integration has been discontinued and will not be replaced."" (The action is to just stop using the feature) outright.
- Sometimes not immediately actionable:
  - ""The X feature is deprecated, it will be replaced in milestone Y.yy.""
  - ""This feature's behavior will change in future milestone Y.yy""

We also have trouble with many deprecation notices not really being deprecations, but being written as such to make it fit on the page, because there is no other place for these announcements. For example (paraphrased):

- Using this feature in the Premium tier is deprecated and will be removed in 15.0. It is not deprecated for use in Ultimate.
- Using more than X jobs in a pipeline is deprecated and will be removed in 15.0.

### Removals

Similar to the issues raised in the breaking changes section above, the removals page will have a huge variety of types of removals in 15.0 (if we use the earlier deprecation notices as a prediction). But many of these will not be things we'd consider deprecations, but are listed there because they are breaking changes that we want people to be aware of.

### Product documentation

Outside of the deprecation/removals pages, we have a lot of feature docs that may or may not also have details about the upcoming changes, and I'm not sure we've got a solid standard for what to do with the feature docs. 

- Should deprecation/removal warnings be in the feature docs too?
- Should removed features continue to be documented to support self-managed users on older versions that are still supported by GitLab support?

## Brainstorming

I believe we should make significant changes to our processes for deprecations/removals/breaking changes, and have some ideas.

### Idea 1 - Limit use of `Deprecation` terminology

We should only use the term `Deprecation` when we mean: ""Stop doing A, start doing B.""

In many cases, it seems like ""End of development"" announcements might make more sense. For a real example: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#only--except. This is even more useful when there is no replacement yet available.

### Idea 2 - New page for important announcements

Instead of a deprecation page and a removal page, we could have one ""Notable changes"" (title TBD) page where we list everything we think people should really know about. It can be important changes to feature in the current milestone, or planned changes to features in future milestones.

Breaking changes of **any** kind can then be added to the page. New limits, feature changes, removals, etc. If it's important for people to know, we can put it there.

We have badges in the docs (see the red ultimate here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/gitlab_self_monitoring_project/#take-action-on-prometheus-alerts), with on-hover text, and a link. We could add a new `Breaking Change` badge to add to all sections on this doc that are considered breaking changes. On-hover text will give a little bit more detail, and clicking it will bring you to a page that gives more details about breaking changes in general. Like major "".0"" milestones for most breaking changes, minor milestones for important security fixes, etc.

Sorting up for discussion, but perhaps some kind of ""Milestone when you can/need to do something about it"". For example, a deprecation could be announced in any milestone, but perhaps should be listed under the milestone when the replacement is expected to be available. A removal warning for an integration being dropped in 15.0 with no replacement should be a breaking change warning listed under 15.0.

### Idea 3 - Have boilerplate language for product docs

Similar to our documentation for feature flagged features: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/feature_flags.html#use-a-note-to-describe-the-state-of-the-feature-flag

We should have a warning box style for important notices about the feature (or we can just reuse `FLAG:`), along with a collection of standard language that can be copied and pasted into the box and added to the feature docs themselves. 

I expect the language to be simple and clear, and easily pasted as needed. You may need to mix and match. Some potential examples:

- This feature has reached end of development and will no longer receive updates, but can still be used.
- This feature is deprecated. You should now use Y instead.
- This feature will be removed in X.xx. You will need to use Y.
- This limit will be increased/decreased in X.xx. To prepare, you should Y.
- This feature's feature flag will be enabled by default in XX.x. To prepare, self managed users can X. SaaS users can Y.
- etc... (these are all just quick ideas, the language is not polished yet)

## Extras

- Should we be thinking about severity of the changes?
- We should research what other companies are doing for these kinds of announcements.
- I imagine self managed users would love it if all breaking changes were added 2 releases ahead of a major milestone, but behind a disabled feature flag. They'd have two full releases to enable the flag whenever they want, and they'd be fully ready when the major milestone comes around that sets the flag to enabled by default (because it'll already be enabled on their instance). Wouldn't work for SaaS...
- How to handle security breaking change announcements?

# OLD Previous Issue discussion

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/82646#note_874257859, @ngaskill points out:

> It seems like we're experiencing some scope creep as to what qualifies as a deprecation/removal. I've also been asked by other PMs to add things to the deprecation/removal doc that aren't deprecations or removals. To my knowledge, the deprecations/removals doc isn't for breaking changes that aren't caused by feature deprecations/removals. Something for the TW team to discuss.

Is _everything_ we are adding to the ""deprecations"" and ""removals"" pages truly a deprecation or removal?

Some examples of breaking changes that are not deprecations:

- A project setting changing from default disabled to default enabled. Happens from time to time, and could easily be a breaking change, but not a deprecation.
- Instance limit updates. Happens quite frequently actually, usually to improve performance or reduce potential abuse of a limit that was too high. You try to rewrite it to make it more like a deprecation by focusing on the ability that is being removed: ""The ability to create job names with more than 256 characters is being deprecated"". I don't think most people consider that a deprecation though, and it might be more easily understood as simply a new limit: ""We are introducing a limit on the length of job names"" (not a deprecation).

So how do we handle notifying users about:

- Non-breaking change deprecations.
- Breaking change deprecations.
- Breaking changes to features that are not being deprecated, ex: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#changes-to-the-ci_job_jwt
- New instance limits, ex: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#cicd-job-name-length-limit
- Tightening of security, like stricter permissions, ex: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#graphql-permissions-change-for-package-settings

Right now, they are all being put in the same deprecations and removals pages due to being similar, but they are not exactly the same.

### Proposals

Perhaps we should:

- Rename the pages? Some initial brainstorming ideas:
  - `Deprecations and planned changes` / `Removals and changes`
  - `Deprecations and announcements` / `Removals and important changes`
  - `Deprecations and planned breaking changes` / `Removals and breaking changes`
  - `Planned changes` / `Important changes by GitLab release version`
  - `Planned breaking changes` / `Breaking changes by GitLab release`
- Change what's on the page?

  A lot of the suggestions above relate to changing the focus on the pages from deprecations to essentially ""Any important change we really want users to be aware of"". So perhaps, along with a rename, we should change what kind of content is on these pages. Looking at deprecations, for example, these are some of the options:
  - List all deprecations only, both breaking and non-breaking. <- Current
  - List all deprecations, and also non-deprecation changes that are breaking.
  - List only breaking changes. That includes deprecations, but does NOT include deprecations that are not breaking changes.

    This is an interesting idea, because I suspect what people really need/want to know are the _breaking changes_, no matter the type. Deprecations that are not breaking, like the removal of support of some integration that already didn't work because the related product itself is gone, doesn't need to be documented here, does it? It could be handled in the regular feature docs?

102175774,2022-02-10 00:03:05.879,Release Post Item generator is creating MRs for deprecations and removals in the wrong repo,"### Description

For context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/84700#note_837950452

Since deprecations and removals used to be release blog post items, the generator creates MRs in `www-gitlab-com` if an Issue matches any `release post item::` label.

Which includes ~""release post item::deprecation"" and ~""release post item::removal""

### Challenge

These MRs are now noisy because we've updated the deprecations and removals process.

Deprecation and removal MRs are now created in the `gitlab` project and compiled directly into GitLab Docs.

### Proposal

- [ ] Tweak the generator so that it only creates MRs for ~""release post item"" Issues and Epics that are not ~""release post item::deprecation"" or ~""release post item::removal""

### Nice to have

- [ ] Create the MR in the `gitlab` project following [the updated process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations)",1

[Content assembly: merging release post items (content blocks) to your branch](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#content-assembly-merging-release-post-items-content-blocks-to-your-branch) could be run on a regular basis by a Bot. The RPM's responsibility would be to check the branch for issues rather than running the assembly themselves.

### Proposal

**Option A: Simple**

Create a job that runs the once nightly, where `X-Y` is the active milestone.

```
  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout release-X-Y
  git pull
  git merge master
  bin/release-post-assemble
  git push
  git push origin release-X-Y
```

**Option B: [Specific](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12865#note_820269872)**

> I think that a commit should queue a pipeline that checks if the branch name matches the release post naming convention (e.g. release-x-y). If the branch matches that naming convention run the content assembly script for every commit. If the pipeline fails, email the committer that their commit needs to be fixed (or better yet, slack them).

>>>
We need to clear up the delineation of Corrective Actions vs infradev escalations as they aren’t the same, yet there is also overlap. 
>>> 

@andrewn also has done weekly reports in this in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/infradev-reports/-/issues/5#summary-by-severity 

### To-DO
- [x] Create Central Eng Metrics for S1 Open Age, S2 Open Age & Table
  - https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/798401/Infrastructure-Embedded-Dashboard
- [x] Create Infradev Summary Dashboard with Filters
  - https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/899982/InfraDev
- [x] add metric for # of related incidents of infradev issues to match what gets shown in Andrew's infradev report
  - tracking in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12226

### Requirements

* Create a new filterable equivalent dashboard similar to [corrective actions](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/787921/Corrective-Actions) but only honed in for infradev
* Key charts:
  * Past due infradev
  * Average age of open infradev
  * Ability to view as a holistic view that can drill down to each product groups
* We need to be able to see how each product teams are doing and if they are able to keep up. 
* Lean on our philosophy of measuring open things


### Examples of the key charts 

![Screen_Shot_2021-08-04_at_6.33.33_AM](/uploads/8a2210a7f573cdfe87621b7cdbb7fafa/Screen_Shot_2021-08-04_at_6.33.33_AM.png)
   

## Plan 
* We are aligned on the metric `Open InfraDev Age`. This aligns with other Eng PIs (OMA, OBA, Open UX Debt Age) Reasons:
  * As a long-term indicator, provide a measure that captures the total effort. Average Age of Open achieves this, we give credit to efforts when any open issue is fixed
  * Give agency to each team to prioritize what is most severe, a recent infradev S2 may need action now than an older infradev S2 (example from this https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333184) 
  * Facilitate a 2 way direction of recognizing completed efforts and feedback loop. e.g. 
    * A product group team is doing well if `Open InfraDev Age` is going down.
    * A product group team needs help if `Open InfraDev Age` is going up.
    * Slice this by severity
  * This negates the complication of restarting SLOs when severity shifts, we set teams to focus on burning down infradev in each severity as one bucket. The first being S1 and S2 which is the agreed on path from the last meeting.
* @davis_townsend to create:
  * Open InfraDev Age S1 chart (add total number of issues in the backdrop)
  * Open InfraDev Age S2 chart (add total number of issues in the backdrop)
* @lmai1 to add a table at the end showing list of Open infradev issues (S1/S2)
* @lmai1 will ensure the handbook dashboard structure is accurate https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12154 
* This dashboard https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/798401/Infrastructure-Embedded-Dashboard is filterable down to every stage and group and is in our handbook dashboards https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/dev/create/#infrastructure-indicators
  * This will provide visibility into each teams and if we need to dial up more
* Separately we already have types of MRs merged per stage/group in the Development Indicators section of the same pages
  * This will tell us what type of work needs to increase/decrease
  * ![Screen_Shot_2021-07-29_at_12.25.35_PM](/uploads/a5016302b997c47c4afffa93dce6ffcc/Screen_Shot_2021-07-29_at_12.25.35_PM.png)
* We aim to have this in by next Engineering Allocation meeting.

Examples:

* https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/
* https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/

We should investigate if this mainly a problem with the query times of the PIs or with rendering time of the charts

If the issue is rendering time, will probably need help from others to improve that, but if the issue the queries we can improve that load time by optimizing the longest running queries, & eliminating excess PI charts


## Ideas 

### Backend performance

* @davis is currently looking into query performance
* Davis: Looked at query times of the underlying performance. Have processing be done at Snowflake. 

### Frontend performance

* Render only KPIs Don’t render charts for (Regular) RPIs, requiring a click thru to Sisense instead
* Lazy load RPIs on scroll
* Only render RPIs in a popup/modal if someone mouses-over an icon
* Other?

89195597,2021-06-23 20:05:46.418,"Create a ""Confidential"" Health state for PIs","## Summary

With a increasing emphasis on correctly maintaining confidential information many of the Infrastructure PIs no longer indicate [health status](https://0623-sloyd-infra-pi.about.gitlab-review.app/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#health), but by doing so the status defaults to ""Unknown"".

![image](/uploads/22df651aeea4b8ab7bf3d4d4875bee71/image.png)

This is confusing though as there is a difference between what we really intend when we show status Unknown vs. when it is actually known but just can't be displayed due to confidentiality.

## Proposal
- Create a ""Confidential"" Health status with appropriate icon...(maybe transparent background with black text so as not to imply anything via other coloring?)
- Update the Health legend in the template for all PIs
- Review all Eng department PIs for those which should switch to use the new status

## Actions
- [ ] Discuss among Engineering Data Analytics and Eng Dept heads to validate the problem.
- [ ] Eng Data Analytics represents the proposal to other Divisions
- [ ] Implement above proposal (or the iteration we arrive at)",3

### Challenges
- Team implements this via 2 code sections and is the equivalent of creating 2 charts into 1.
- Explore helpers 
  - Is there a visualization library that we can plug in ? do it at the visualization level and not the calculation.
  - render API ? for “color” gives no result, so not looking promising
  - ask Sisense what’s possible in terms of styling that doesn’t muddy up business logic?

86405048,2021-05-03 18:35:35.945,Optional DRI Attribute to PIs,"In Infra, we have unofficially had DRIs for specific sections of metrics for awhile.

As an example, I would handle cost metrics, Director of infra, reliability handles incident related metrics, and senior manager, delivery & scalability would handle MTTP and other metrics around deployments/scaling.
Ultimately the metrics still have department head as DRI for the page overall in case someone is out or update missed.

I think this has worked out pretty well for us, and we were talking about making this kind of delegation of PIs official in the page and document what that DRI would be responsible for.

This change would be:
- adding DRI attribute to PI pages
- handbook documentation on what denoted DRI, department head, CTO (or applicable position above department heads), and analysts are responsible for in relation to the PI pages

Idea of documented division of responsibility would break down into:
- listed DRI would be responsible for updating health & health reasons of KPI before each key meeting and answering any related questions in the meeting as well. These DRIs would typically be Directors or Managers who are closest to the metrics if they are delegated this responsibility by their department head.
- Analysts are responsible for maintaining shared PIs charts in Sisense across departments (Inherited PIs) and supporting DRIs with creation of their department specific PI charts in Sisense.
- Department heads are responsible for their PI page overall, so covering for any PIs without delegated DRI and in case someone is out.
- CTO is responsible for defining the division level PIs that are shared across departments and working with department heads on setting targets for these

This issue is for visualization related issues within our BI tool.

#### What is the original Periscope dashboard/link? 

https://app.periscopedata.com/shared/fc54cf54-e5f9-4708-9dfe-9e4c921ac79e?

#### Please link to where this (or these) performance indicator/s are defined in the handbook. 

https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/performance-indicators/#support-department-mr-rate

#### What are your requested changes?

Two changes:

1. Target is defined at 5 MRs per month, but target line shows at 10. Should be corrected.
1. (Like to have, not required) Add a table that would show in dashboard (but not in handbook embed) of number of MRs by Gitlab username. Sorted descending by total MRs.

#### What is the business question you are trying to answer? 

For change 2, which ICs may need help to complete contributions?

#### What is the impact of this question and how will it help the company?

Identification of individuals who may need additional assistance would encourage them to contribute and increase results in KPI.

#### What time frames are crucial here? 

Should be total for entire time frame (year) of dashboard. ICs who make even a small number of contributions in a year likely do not need additional help.

#### What is the visualization you are trying to create?

Include any links or screenshots, if appropriate. As a rule of the thumb, the analytics team uses 12 visualization types. They are:

1. Simple Text

| GitLab username | Total number of MRs |
| ------ | ------ |
| cynthia | 5 |
| jcolyer | 2 |

#### What is the source of data behind the visualization?

GitLab. Hopefully the same source as already used in the dashboard.

#### What interactions/drill downs are required?

No filters required.

#### Any caveats or details that may be helpful?",1

We want to share the behind the scenes story of how we are scaling our Demo Systems hands-on lab infrastructure from 500 to 5,000+ users as we live our values of collaboration, iteration, results and transparency, even when it’s hard.
```

```
introduction:

Last week we posted a [blog article](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/04/20/everyone-can-get-certified/) about our new self-paced GitLab certification program with hands-on labs that included a 100% discount code. 

The Professional Services team was excited to release this offering and from a hands-on lab infrastructure capacity, it was considered to be just another addition to our growing list of self-paced training offerings with hands-on labs that haven’t had any capacity challenges in the past. What we didn't anticipate is the interest that this would generate when it was published on our blog and shared virally on social media. As it turns out, when you offer something for free to our 30,000,000+ users, there is certainly going to be some interest! 

I want to share the behind the scenes story of how we are scaling our Demo Systems hands-on labs infrastructure from 500 to 5,000+ users, and some of the business and technical challenges that we’ve had to overcome in the last week. At GitLab, we try to live our values of collaboration, iteration, results, and transparency, even when it’s hard. We’re not perfect, however here is the story of what happened and how we’re iterating to make things better for everyone.

We opened [this issue](https://gitlab.com/brollik/scaleway/-/issues/1) for the purpose of feedback and suggested edits.

## Proposal

Related to: https://twitter.com/kubermatic/status/1374357606412779522?s=27

Our blog post about GitOps, terraform, etc. was one of the most read posts we've ever published so I know that this will be a hot topic. I'm not totally sure what the angle here is, I will leave that up to you @abuango, but I think that if we do something like ""How to use Terraform with Kubernetes and GitLab"" that could be great.

85640226,2021-04-21 12:07:53.129,Blog post: Loading large requests on the frontend in increasingly larger batches,"<!-- PLEASE READ: See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/unfiltered for details on the Unfiltered blog process.-->

### Proposal

<!-- What do you want to blog about? Add your description here -->

#### Potential Titles

* Loading large requests on the frontend in increasingly larger batches
* Loading increasingly large batches to render large MRs faster
* Batch Diff loading with increasing payloads
* Incrementally loading large merge request diffs in batches
* ....

#### Goal 

Go over the journey of shipping batch diffs and tweaking them for better performance in large Merge Requests

#### Outline

* Establish the previously shipped batch diffs. Pain points of lots of requests/iterations for large MRs
* Slow start of TCP/IP
* Actual implementation with minimum (1st request fast), growing up to a point (beware of BE load)
* Results
* Future work: parallelisation. (problem: how to handle order?)",2

Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. -->

## Triage (REQUIRED)

The Inbound Marketing team prioritizes requests that drive results and meet our [goals of generating organic traffic and inquiries](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#goals).

Visual Studio Code & the GitLab workflow extension are a great help. The idea is to provide a story line from the first code & git init/add to a fully fledged workflow with merges, publishing, etc. - similar to the [quick actions story line](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/18/improve-your-gitlab-productivity-with-these-10-tips/). 

Existing SCM/Git integration & optional CLI access for fast resolving e.g. merge conflicts could also be interesting (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol). Or a best practice extension which makes daily live easier?

Existing blog posts:

- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/03/01/gitlab-vscode-extension/
- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/31/use-gitlab-with-vscode/

- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/25/mr-reviews-with-vs-code/ 

This is a follow-up idea from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/2874#note_549700745 - currently not planning on writing this myself.

<!-- What do you want to blog about? Add your description here. If you are making an announcement, please open an `announcement` request issue in the Corporate Marketing project instead: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#requests-for-announcements -->

This blog will be about GitOps best practices, how GitLab enables the automation of infrastructure as code and how our technology partner, Indeni, helps to secure IaC. The blog post is entitled:[Getting GitOps right with IaC Security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11knV2J0fRKQa49TYXLx8TgVss1TuOUCa9e2CzgX5EBY/edit?ts=6046bbc9#heading=h.yhp0ki8yozp). @cblake and @stkerr on our Secure team have already provided input and feedback to Indeni on this blog post.

This blog post ties into one of our overarching sales plays - GitOps. We would like to release the blog prior to or in coordination with the GitOps GTM sales play.
