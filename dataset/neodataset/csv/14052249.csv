70779892,2020-09-06 06:59:12.296,[Bug] Chat Message Failure (class Dice.RollResult: Value class Dice.DieResult cannot be deserialized.),"# Summary

Occasionally, Chat Message fail to send. This occurs after sending a group of messages together.

## Steps to reproduce

Send any dice roll.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

The message will be received and output. All subsequent messages will not be received. Reloading results in an error loading all message.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Well, messages will be transmitted.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

70775235,2020-09-05 21:23:28.476,[Improvement] Transition Character to Collection in back-end,"# Description

Transitioning Characters to a Collection will impact the structure of the stored data, so it'll be best to implement this before the First Playable release: otherwise, we'll effectively have to wipe the players' campaign data and start again.

## Current State

Characters are handled separately from other collections on the back end. There's no real benefit to keeping these separate, it's just an artifact from an earlier iteration of the back end.

## How should it look/feel?

Characters should be migrated to a Collection. Back-end methods dealing with Characters specifically should be removed. Front-end methods dealing with Characters should interact with the Collection instead.

## Implementation

- On map tokens - campaign/collection/tokens
- In Library characters - user/collection/characters

1. Log in to URL: edge.mythictable.com
2. Select play campaign
3. Copy URL
4. Log in to separate account (not a member of the campaign)
5. Paste URL in browser
6. You will be able to see session and interact with campaign.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?
play/{CampaignId}/debug does not restrict access to campaign members

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?
play/{CampaignId}/debug path should only allow campaign members to join. If a user who is not a member attempts to join a live session, an appropriate error should be displayed.

Currently we don't have a any scope on most of our labels and as a result their purpose can be confused. Furthermore

Scope seems to fix this as only one label of any scope can be applied to a ticket at any given time.

# Description

This Improvement Project experiments with the idea of authing vs the edge env.

## Background/Current State

Currently we're using a local Mythic Auth or Keycloak instance that we're are authing against.

## The Problem

Some people struggle with the complexity that this introduces or have limitations on their local machines that prevent using a local auth solution.

## Solution

Mythic Auth supports both Edge and Local environments automatically. Or at least it has both configurations loaded. It might be simple to point a local env at the edge auth service.

## Description

The command for running MongoDB locally should include a volume for persistence of the stored data.

### Background/Current State

Currently using the provided command no data will be stored on the host system's disk. This prevents the data from being persistent.

### The Problem

Every time the MongoDB Container is killed all stored data will be lost

### Solution

Add a volume to the provided command

# Technology Improvement Project - SignalR Backplane

## Description

In order to support scaling the Mythic Table API service, we need to implement a SignalR Backplane.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/scale?view=aspnetcore-3.1

### Background/Current State

Currently we're limiting the Mythic Table Server to a single instance. This will not scale when we finally release the First Playable.

### The Problem

SignalR is a Websocket technology. As such it is stateful and has no awareness of client connections on different instances. The SignalR backplane is a communication layer that solves this problem.

### Solution

SignalR Backplane https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/scale?view=aspnetcore-3.1

## Steps

- [x] Create a Configuration for Mythic Table to use a Backplane
- [x] Build a Redis Backplane in GCP
- [x] Configure our environments to commission a the Redis Backplane
- [x] Configure our deployment to utilize the Backplane
- [x] Configure our deployment to use multiple instances
- [x] Confirm functional systems with multiple users

## Testing Plan

In order to test this we must be VERY sure that there is no (extremely low) possibility that tests have all ended up on the same server instance. So, repeated testing is highly recommended.

- [x] Users can all load into campaigns
- [x] Users can change maps, move tokens, send chat messages and draw
- [x] All of the above events can be seen by at least two other connected clients.

It might be a good idea to compare the INGRESSCOOKIE values between clients. These should have different values

69873534,2020-08-16 06:44:14.289,[Improvement] Characters to use Collections,"# Technology Improvement Project - 

## Description

The Collections have been set up to be the data source for all game data. Character specific data is a duplication of this for the most part.  This should be moved over to the Collections system.

### Background/Current State

We started with a very naive approach to characters. We then introduced the ability to update them with Json Patches.
After that we designed the Collection system to be a generic system for this kind of data. This Collection system was
used for scenes and players and has been working very well.

### The Problem

- Duplication
- Out of date functionality

### Solution

Move Characters over to Collections

### Additional Information

There should be a lot of clean up when this is done as well. There is a lot of bloated and complex code around how
character changes are notified to other clients. 

## Steps

- [ ] Implement a character collection
- [ ] Create a proxy store module like the Player Store
- [ ] Remove the old character classes
- [ ] Grab the `patch` function for GameStore and use that as a generic patch utility for Collections
- [ ] Clean up all the unused code in `LivePlayDirector` and `GameStore`

As a user, I can log into the Mythic Table service.

## Details

Currently, Mythic Table uses the Mythic Auth service. We would like to move away from this instead of supporting it.  This story represents work needed to switch over to Keycloak.

## Steps

- [x] Keycloak investigations @kdvalin 
- [x] Keycloak Local Env
- [x] Database configuration https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#_database

- [x] Add account management to the Mythic Table site https://keycloak.mythictable.com/auth/realms/MythicTable/account
- [x] Keycloak for Edge
- [x] Custom Registration field for joining the newsletter https://keycloakthemes.com/blog/how-to-add-custom-field-keycloak-registration-page
- [ ] [Optional] Set up email service for Keycloak

## TODOs

- [x] Don't let them change their username if we stick with email as username or find an user ID
- [x] Newsletter checkbox does not work on auth/realms/MythicTable/account
- [x] Update the Mythic Server reference to User ID
- [ ] The title in the register template

As a new player, I can use a guest user for my first time experience with the game. It will have the default campaign and it will automatically be logged in and authenticated. 

There will be an option to associate this guest user with a real account at any time.

Session state is tracked via a long-lived cookie.

## Details

There will be an option to associate this guest user with a real account at any time.

Session state is tracked via a long-lived cookie. Refreshing the page will not cause the account to be reset.

## Steps

BE
- [ ] Unauthenticated endpoint `guest/startsession` returns a cookie/session/user id for the player, and starts a new default campaign based on a default template (initially empty, but we will design an initial session template)
- [ ] Unauthenticated endpoint `guest/resumesession` allows a guest to reconnect and resume the guest campaign using the saved long-lived session cookie
- [ ] Endpoint `guest/associateaccount` puts the user into the same flow as registering an account, except once completed the back end will tie together backend resources related to the guest account (using the cookie to get the generated id for the guest user) with the new logged in/created user

FE
- [ ] Have a button or UX to start a guest session, that calls the backend start session endpoint
- [ ] If refreshing or somehow the websocket is dropped, use the resume session and saved long lived cookie to resume where the guest session left off
- [ ] UX to start the associate account workflow - brings up a similar flow to login/create user, except will call associate account to ensure the back end ties the guest account's data to the new account.

Design Work

Design work for the initial session (map(s), characters, any other art/resources needed) - This is tracked in #110 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Able to start a new guest session
- [ ] Refreshing the page doesn't cause a new guest session to be created (if one was already made)
- [ ] Closing the browser and restarting doesn't cause a new guest session to be created (if one was already made)
- [ ] Able to tie guest session details to a newly created user
- [ ] Able to tie guest session details to an existing user whose session you log into",8

## Details

In order to make the First Playable more approachable, we'll use a default campaign with a map and some characters for the players to have a little fun.

### IMPORTANT

Be sure to change the campaign management page to show only campaigns that you are in

## Steps

#### Backend

- [x] A Default Campaign is created when a user first joins Mythic Table
- [x] Update the backend to only return campaigns that the user is a GM or Player in.

#### Frontend

## Details

Currently, the UI is very cluttered and disorganized.  This needs to be improved. We have a design to use docking collapsible windows that we can move around but basically behave like xylophones when docked together.

## Steps
### UX
#### Windows (Modules)
- [x] Sidebar to optionally contain collapsible windows
- [x] Allow the windows to collapse / expand
- [ ] ~~Add docking mechanic ( Allow windows to dock to each other or sidebar)~~
- [ ] ~~Persist last used window position~~

- [ ] ~~Spell images~~

#### Header (In Progress)
- [x] Back to Campaign List
- [x] Draw
- [x] Username and Signout

#### Scene Library
- [x] Improve asset upload workflow



#### Player Profile
- [x] Player profile editing
- [x] Player profile image upload
- [x] Player Profile image available on campaigns they are in
- [x] Player Profile image scenes/maps
- [x] Player Profile image chat messages
- [x] Player Profile Skinning
- [x] Player Profile MongoDB Implementation


### UI
- [x] Header w/logo
- [x] Implement styling from [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/RL16gwbmVarJt2JYa2eyMp/Mythic-Table_AP_TN-v0.5?node-id=572%3A0&viewport=-3915%2C790%2C1&scaling=scale-down)


### Backend

As a player, I see only the relevant campaigns that I am apart of on the campaign management screen. It is easy for me to create a new campaign and I can find out how to join existing games easily. I can also upload an image to as as a display image for campaigns.

## Details

Currently, we're displaying all campaigns.  This will not do when we release First Playable. This is the first experience more players will have with this product. We should allow them to test it out very easily.

## Steps

- [x] On campaign features page a ""choose file"" and ""upload"" buttons should be added to ""Create New Campaign"" section in order to select a banner image, upload it, and associate it to the campaign which has been created.

- [x] Users should have a main Campaign page where he/she can see the created campaigns, and interact with them.

- [x] Once a campaign is created it should have a button like ""info"" to display all the information about it, such as campaign creation date, last time played, description, invite link, delete campaign, and play button.

- [x] Clicking on ""Delete"" button should remove a campaign from the main view campaing page, and clicking on ""Edit"" button should update campaign's content such as description, banner, and etc.

- [x] Campaign Description textarea on ""Create New Campaign"" page should have enough ""cols"", ""rows"" and length in order to convey necessary information for the campaign.

- [x] Menu creation on header next to the logo.

- [x] Start Date and Last Played must be implemented on campaign's description field.

- [x] Campaign's images should not be stretched or skewed.


## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] User can upload image as a banner for their campaign. It should be displayed in the campaign list page without distortion (Uploaded banner should be displayed in campaigns list page without distortion.)
- [x] User can create a campaign description which scan be viewed entirely in the campaign info card. (campaigns description should fit in textarea field in campaigns list page)
- [x] User can display additional information not shown in the campaign card on an Info Card. (info button should display all the campaign's information on the right side of the page and having scroll down feature.)
- [x] User can enjoy a campaign manager which matches the light-theme standards. (Light-theme (Needs clarification @mfaulise))
- [x] User can see the date the campaign was created on and the last date the campaign was played. (Display campaigns' creation and 'last played' dates correctly.)
- [x] User can delete the campaign through targeted clicking/2 step deletion verification and have it removed from the campaign list page (Clicking ""Delete"" in the Info pop-up removes the campaign from the list page. )
- [x] User can access the Campaign Editor through the Info Card. (Clicking ""Edit"" in the Info pop-up brings the user back to the Campaign editor screen.)",5
51846152,2020-06-30 00:42:48.181,[Story] Change the primary branch from 'master' to 'main',"## User Story

As a developer, I refer to `main` as the default branch for Mythic Table

## Problem to solve

This story follows the reasoning of the following Gitlab issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222204

The default branch of this repository is current master. We should move to a different default branch name for Mythic Table for two reasons:

1. master is not easily understood by people new to Git, and is not a ubiquitous term in technology (master is more easily associated with primary/secondary configurations)
1. master has multiple meanings in English, including master/slave. Although Git does not use master/slave terminology, such terminology was common until recently. Use of master/slave terminology has been removed in recent versions of many major software projects because it is not technically descriptive, precise, and avoids needlessly referencing the awful history and impact of human/slavery which continues to be felt by people all over the world.

## Steps

- [x] change pipeline to use main instead of master for deployment
- [x] create main branch from master
- [x] make main the default branch
- [x] update release processes to use main branch
- [x] update Developer documentation
- [ ] ... probably many other steps
- [x] remove master branch

As a player in trouble-hunters, I can use https://edge.mythictable.com/ to play our game

## Details

Currently, the default campaign is a single map with a couple of static tokens. We will need to change the map and add tokens for each character and a couple of enemies.

We will also need to hook up the movement syncing between clients.

We will also need to add the user name to the dice rolling results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All player characters have tokens
- [x] There are a couple of monsters tokens (Use colored tokens for now)
- [x] The map reflects the map needed for Trouble Hunters
- [x] Movement on one client is reflected on all clients
- [x] When a die is rolled, the username of the roller is shown

30382289,2020-02-04 17:56:06.885,[Story] Finalize CSS architecture,"## User Story

As a front-end developer, I want to reuse some styles across multiple components/layouts, while others will be specific to a particular component.

## Details

We currently have shared styles in src/assets/main.scss (in the Campaign Management branch, soon to be merged to master) and component-specific styles (e.g. layouts) in the individual components.

We should create a minimal wiki space for our CSS Architecture to document this breakdown. We can expand it in the future as our architecture evolves.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A CSS Architecture page documents the location of shared CSS components
- [x] A CSS Architecture page describes criteria for keeping CSS elements in the shared file vs. individual components

As a user, I can I can add, edit and removed campaigns from the campaign management scene 

## Details

Campaigns will have the following information:
- Title
- Description
- Image URL
- Created and Last modified date
- A list of player

For now we will use imgur to host the images for the site. The list of players can be chosen from the list of registered users in the application.

This is all placeholder and requires no specific UI at this time except the UI required to confirm the functionality.

This feature will include persistence in some manner.  This could be in memory persistence for the time being.

## Steps

- [x] Define models and DbContext
- [x] Define Controllers
- [x] Unit test at controller level
- [x] Add players
- [x] Remove players
- [x] Add Authentication and automatically associate owner
- [ ] Add Vue elements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The user can see a list of their campaigns
- [ ] The user can edit a campaign as described above
- [ ] The user can delete a campaign
- [ ] The user can add a new campaign
- [ ] The user can enter the campaign but it takes them into the default LivePlay session

## Data concerns

The data store chosen for this store is somewhat irrelevant, but a adequate abstraction layer is required.  Consider the following guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1

It's possible to set up a mongodb docker container as a simple first pass for this.

30095136,2020-01-30 03:55:41.013,[Story] DMs can move from scene to scene,"## User Story

As a player and I switch from scene to scene 

## Details

### Current state

Currently, we have a single default scene made. You can edit the background and the scale. Changes to these are instantly reflected in each other client.

### Next Steps

In order for this feature to work, players need the ability to add scenes. Once they can add additional scenes, they should also be able to remove the scenes they have added.

Once that is done players should be able to move from scene to scene by selecting them, clicking once or double-clicking. This will change them from scene to scene.

There should also be an option for bringing all the connected players to the focused scenes or showing with players are on which scenes.

### UI Needs

We will need the ability to do the following:

- [x] Enable Scene Editing 
- [x] Enable Change to Scene
- [x] Enable the ability to move all players to a scene
- [x] Feedback which scene you are on
- [x] Feedback which scenes others are on
- [x] Feedback when you're been transferred to a new scene
- [x] An option to toggle automatic scene transferring

## Steps

### Backend

- [x] This will use the scene collection and the collection API for adding and removing scenes
- [x] LivePlay API for adding and removing collections will be needed
- [x] A LivePlay API will be needed to handle scene traversal This can be done with a single campaign collection as well

### Frontend

- [x] Clicking add scene opens a blank scene editor window
- [x] Editor window changes `Save` button to `Add`
- [x] Cancel closes window without adding the scene
- [x] Adding sends the data to the server as a add collection LivePlay API call
- [x] Listen for Collection Item Added and update the scene library
- [x] Decide if single or double click is for scene editing @calamity_jane 
- [x] Add a `selected` state for the Scene Items
- [x] Select Scene item on click
- [x] Change Scene on Select
- [x] Send a scene change message to the server
- [x] Listen to the scene change from server to change to a new scene

### Independent Scene Movement

With this feature, players can be on different scenes

- [x] Define a campaign collection for tracking player's scene activity
- [x] Show player indicators on scenes in library
- [x] Define a UX for bringing players over to a specific scene
- [x] Wire up the scenes to the collection API
- [x] Player change scene - Other players see it in their scene library
- [x] Player is moved to a scene - their active scene changes
- [ ] [Optional] Players can lock themselves so they are not moved from scene to scene
- [ ] [Optional] Locked players have a special indicator showing they cannot be moved

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Player's can add new scenes
- [x] Players can move between scene
- [x] Players can move other players between scenes",5
30095131,2020-01-30 03:55:06.422,[Story] DMs can edit maps size and properties,"## User Story

As a DM, I can edit maps size and properties

## Details

For the purposes of First Playable, a map has two things: A background image and a play surface (grid). Map editing must support changing both of these things and persisting the changes. 

## Tasks

Backend: 

- [x] Stub map/scene APIs
 - [GET] api/campaigns/###/scenes
 - [Live] `AddScene`, `RemoveScene`, `UpdateScene`, `MoveToScene`
 - [Event] `SceneAdded`
 - [Event] `SceneRemoved`
 - [Event] `SceneUpdated` or plugged into `ConfirmOpDelta`
- [x] InMemory implementation
- [x] Decouple campaign collections from users @jhatheway or @mfaulise 
- [x] MongoDB implementation

Frontend:

- [x] Define and create a default scene when campaigns are created
- [x] Have the UI automatically get scenes on load as we do with the characters for the campaign and the rolls
- [x] Build getScenes in the UI to populate the Scene Library
- [x] Double click a scene in the library to open a scene editor window
- [x] Build the scene editor window 
- [x] Wire up the editor window to update the scene on save
- [x] Wire up the editor window to send an update to the backend on save
- [x] Change the image associated with a map
- [x] Change the grid parameters (height and width of grid)

## Acceptance Criteria

https://edge.mythictable.com

- [x] Users can change background image of a map/scene
- [x] Users can change the size of a map/scene
- [x] Map/scene changes are persistent between sessions 
- [x] Map/scene changes are reflected in the clients of other users 

## Data concerns

Maps have different properties than characters, so it will be necessary to make any additions for that purpose in such a way that the files API remains the same as it is after #60.

## Security concerns

Same as character creation.

30095123,2020-01-30 03:54:07.893,[Story] Map Library,"## User Story

As a DM, I can add a new map to my map library.

## Details

This story introduces another library window. This window will be used to manage DM and Player maps. Instead of the simple file interface for the character library displays, this one should reference campaign map objects which inturn reference an image file for display in the list and as the base image for the map.

In order to do this, we will need to add a context to the file upload to distinguish between character images and maps images. This will be required on the API level and propagated down to the server implementation.

We will also need APIs to create map objects in the campaign. 

On the UI side of things, we'll have a window titled `Map Library`. It will have a scrollable selectable list of maps displayed by their image. There will be an Add Button on the bottom

Clicking the add button opens a dialog box with the map properties, but this will only have an image upload option at this stage.

## Steps

Frontend:

- [x] Window/list of maps
- [x] Button/interface to add map
- [ ] Concept of ""choosing"" a map (for editing or otherwise)
- [ ] (Optional) Button/interface to delete map

Backend:

- [x] API to return all maps or scenes
- [x] API to add a map or scene
- [ ] (Optional) API to delete a map or scene
- [x] Create a InMemory datastore for maps
- [x] Create a MongoDB datastore for maps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can add a map
- [ ] User sees all maps available
- [ ] When a user goes to a new campaign he sees all of his available maps

## Data concerns

This may use the same API as the character images.  In this case we will need to differentiate the two with some kind of tag or path.

30095009,2020-01-30 03:42:32.473,[Story] Character Library,"## User Story

As a player or DM, I can create new characters in my library and upload images for them.

## Details

A character library is a user-specific repository for tokens. Instead of uploading tokens to the map, they are uploaded to the library. And then they are dragged out of the library onto the map. Libraries are specific to players. They can only see what they have added.

## Steps

Backend

- [x] Investigate a file storage system in Google Cloud
- [x] Build a Simple API that allows file uploads
- [x] Build a local version of the file store
- [x] Build a Google Cloud version of the file store
- [x] Build a MongoDB Ownership provider
- [x] Fix the failing test `PostReturnFileDtoTest`
- [ ] Log the API calls
- [x] Delete file API

Frontend

- [x] Create an add character button
- [x] Open a file upload option
- [x] Chosing a file invokes the API in step 2
- [x] On complete, add a net image to the list of characters
- [ ] [optional] Delete image
- [ ] [optional] Drag image to library
- [ ] [optional] drag image to battlemap

Operations

- [x] Create Cloud Storage Bucket (mythic-table-image-store-edge)
- [x] Grant `allUsers` `Storage Object Viewer`
- [x] Create a new Google Service Account (mythic-table-api-edge@mythic-table.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
- [x] Grant this new account `Storage Object Admin`
- [x] Create a Workload Identity for KSA see: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Users can add characters to their library
- [x] Other users cannot see these in their library
- [x] Characters can be dragged from a library to the map
- [x] Other users can see tokens added to the map from the library

## Data concerns

This will need a new collection in MongoDB to manage this. It should not impact any other data collections.

We will need to have some kind of file service that allows users to upload files.

30094864,2020-01-30 03:27:10.158,[Story] Players and DMs can edit tokens,"## User Story

As a player or DM, I can edit a character's position and properties. These changes are reflected in other connected clients.

## Details

Any token attributes can be changed. These changes are reflected in other user's clients. In the simplest form of this, tokens have a text area in which users can add/remove and update text. Tokens may also have a name.

## Steps

### Frontend 

- [x] Create a pop-up window when a character is double-clicked. The window can be closed.
- [x] Add a name field to the window
- [x] Add a text field to the window
- [x] Add save and cancel buttons to the window
- [x] Cancel closes the window
- [x] Save closes the window and applies the changes to the character
- [ ] Wire up frontend to the `UpdateCharacter`

### Backend

- [x] Rename `LivePlayHub` `RebroadcastDelta` to `UpdateCharacter` (change the Frontend as well.
- [x] Modify the `CharacterDTO` MongoDB model to be a generic json data object. Ensure MoveCharacter still works.
- [ ] Hook up the `UpdateCharacter` to apply a delta to the character objects without specifically doing a move.
- [x] Create a Data Migration script. Consider something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/migrate-mongo or https://github.com/SRoddis/Mongo.Migration
- [ ] Make a script that will migrate characters to the new format

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can move a character
- [ ] Users can edit a character's text field
- [ ] Users can change a character's name

## Data concerns

This will cause problems with all of the characters in campaigns. The addition to the project of the migrate scripts will greatly reduce the risk of making this change.

## Details

Doing this removes the token from everyone's map. We need a selected state for this to work. We need the ability to select and deselect tokens. Their selection state should be VERY visible.

## Steps

1. [ ] Make a selection state for tokens. Only a single token can be selected at a time. Single-clicking off the token unselects it.
1. [ ] Delete token by pressing DELETE
1. [x] Create a LivePlayHub API to remove the character

As a player or DM, I can add a token of my character or monsters onto the map

## Consessions

Tokens will be taken from a list of prebuilt tokens available in the application for all users. This feature does not include uploading new tokens.

## Details

The simplest form of this problem involves dragging an image from a list of available tokens onto the map and it showing up on everyone else's game scene. From there it can be moved around like other tokens.

## Suggested Steps
FE
1. [x] Hardcode a list of available tokens into the client.
1. [x] Design a Token Library UI that is simply a scrollable list of available tokens.
1. [x] Allow the tokens to be draggable
1. [x] Call BE API on new Token creation
1. [x] Listen for new Tokens announced by BE

BE
1. [x] Create a LivePlayHub API to create a token given a token specifier and a location
1. [x] The API must write the new token into the campaign data
1. [x] The API alerts all other clients of the new Token

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can access a token UI with all possible tokens
- [ ] User can add a token by dragging it onto the map
- [ ] Other users can see the newly added token
- [ ] The token can be dragged and behaves like other tokens in the game

29310461,2020-01-06 00:03:13.016,[Story] Create campaign populates a default GameSession,"## User Story

As a player, I can create a campaign.  Doing so generates a linked persistent Game Session that uses the red keep map and has a number of tokens on it. 

## IMPORTANT

This is another very large story.  When working on this, consider doing one of the following

### Using tasks

Create a subtask from this story and then branch from it

```
git checkout -b issue/82-step-1-for-story-48
```

Merge each completed step into `master`

### Branch for task

Create a subtask from this story and then branch from it

```
git checkout -b issue/48-step-2-decoupled-campaign-data
```

Merge each completed step into `master`

## Details

When a campaign is created via the Campaign Management APIs, it should also initialize a base state for a campaign and save it to persistent storage. Currently, this base state is represented by [data_demo.js](https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/mythictable/-/blob/master/html/src/debug/data_demo.js) on the front end.

On the back end, we need to store a session template with the map and some default icons (use the existing data_demo.js for reference). We need this template to be copied and linked to a campaign ID when a new Campaign is created. When the front end requests a Live session for that campaign ID, the back end should provide the session template as the initial state.

The front end should request the Live session for each campaign, rather than the Demo live session.

Explicitly out of scope for this story:

*  Persisting further changes to the Game State
*  Limiting visibility of state changes within the campaign (covered by #49).

## Suggested Steps

The goal of this to help build an API that will allow the server to populate the map. The end result to the user should not change. The following steps will help ensure that these changes do not impact the end user.

At each of these steps, the system NEEDS to be tested to ensure it's still functioning as expected.

1. [x] Find and document all data used to populate the map and tokens in-game
1. [x] Build a decoupled data representation of available data. It can be hardcoded in json for this step.
1. [x] Replace the inline data from step one with a reference to the data made in step two.
1. [x] Draft an API to fetch campaign data. This API MUST take a campaign ID
1. [x] Have the campaign data URL return the fake data from step 2
1. [x] Make sure the campaign ID is sent from the server when a user enters the campaign
1. [x] console log the campaign id `onload` of the in-game interface
1. [x] Replace the reference created in step three with a call to the new campaign data API
1. [x] Add a step in the create campaign controller to initialize a campaign data object based on the data in step two. Randomize the positions of the tokens in the campaign.
1. [x] Change the API hardcoded in step five to reference the campaign data initialize
1. [x] Verify that loading into campaigns shows the correct state - campaign A's tokens should be positioned differently from campaign B, but campaign A's tokens should keep the same position on a reload

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] After creating a new Campaign, players can click the Play link to go to that campaign's instance of the game session.
- [x] Clicking the Play link on a different campaign will take players to a different game session instance.
- [x] Player can load into one campaign, move a token, load into a different campaign, note the token appears to be at its original location and then load into the first campaign and see the token in the new location.
- [ ] Player can load into one campaign, roll a dice, load into a different campaign, note and empty dice log and then load into the first campaign and see the dice he had rolled earlier.

## Data concerns

Should the initial game state be stored under the Campaign document, or in a separate document linked by ID? I lean towards the latter, to allow the live session data to be split it into a separate service in the future, but am open to alternatives.

## Security concerns

Users should only be able to join the game session if they are an Owner or a Player.

24778719,2019-09-13 21:16:20.965,Autoresolution Stage 1,"From the features page:

Foremost in our feature set is our concept of Auto Resolution. This feature will allow player actions to affect objects over which they may not necessarily have control. The principle is very simple. When a player attempts an action which directly affects an authorized object, that action is sent as a message to our servers. If a Game Master is present, the message is sent to him for approval. When enabled, Auto Resolution will automatically approve the action, and the game state will be updated. Of course, we’re not the first ones to think of this, d20pro has this feature, but our feature will do so much more:

1. Our unique history viewer will allow a Game Master to undo unwanted actions quickly.
2. Auto Resolution can be enabled on a player by player basis. This feature allows you to control which players can have their actions automatically resolved or to stop trouble-making players from affecting everyone’s 
3. Auto Resolution works with player to player actions allowing players to affect each other when the Game Master is not online
4. Our unique feedback system notifies the player when an action has been undone.
5. Our system has a redo option for times when a player has corrected the action. This redo will allow them to preserve their original results.
6. Our system will allow the Game Master to edit the action if something has been forgotten. This feature is useful for situations when a buff was forgotten, or the game has some house rule for which the action has not accounted.

This issue will track the initial discussion, requirements analysis and MVP implementation of this central feature.

<!-- Improvement issues are internal initiatives meant to improve code quality, tests, infrastructure or process -->

# Description

Currently, whenever the keycloak pod is recycled, a new public IP is associated with it.
This causes our SMTP provider to deny emails to be sent by KeyCloak.

We currently fix this by manually fetching the new IP and updating the SMTP provider with it.

## The Problem

This is a manual process, and requires access to our SMTP provider and Kubernetes cluster, which only a few people have.

## Background/Current State

There is a rough shell script to fetch the IP address of the pod

```bash
#!/bin/bash

deploy_name='mythic-key'
pod_list=`kubectl get pods -A --no-headers=true | grep $deploy_name`
ns=`echo $pod_list | cut -d' ' -f1`
pod=`echo $pod_list | awk '{print $2}'`

kubectl exec -n $ns pod/$pod -- curl icanhazip.com -s
```

## Solution

Automate the updating of the SMTP relay service

## Additional Information

## Steps

- [ ] TBD

<!-- Improvement issues are internal initiatives meant to improve code quality, tests, infrastructure or process -->

# Description

Remove the duplication in the gitlab yaml (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) for the First Playable

We want to remove this duplication to make it easier to release different versions.

One of the things we also want to do is to get away from making releases via branching. 
Instead we can use the gitlab `Release` feature which should work via tags. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/

We can consider switching to Rules. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules


## The Problem

The following stages are duplicated:
- deploy (deploy:fp)
- build:client (build:client:fp)
- package (package:fp)
- containerize (containerize:fp)

## Background/Current State

Hack for FP release

The way things currently work is that the branch for fp `releases/firstplayable` is specified in the `only`
field of the jobs.

```
build:client:fp:
    ...
    only:
        - releases/firstplayable
```

## Solution

We need to be able to:
* parameterize `- npm run build -- --mode firstplayable` in the `build:client` or
* Remove the need for the `.env` files altogether or
* Use gitlab variables to control the build https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/

There will be some Frontend work
- We need to get away from using the node .env files

## Additional Information

## Steps

- [ ] Stop referencing the docker image by `latest`

87923356,2021-05-30 06:32:56.316,[Polish] Tutorial map has no invite ui.,"<!-- Title suggestion: [Polish] Name of improvement -->
<!-- Polish issues track work to improve the look, feel and usability of existing features -->

# Description

Clean up the UX to either allow or dis-avow inviting users to the tutorial.

1 of these:
1. Add an explicit part of the tutorial that covers inviting friends and allow invites to the tutorial.
2. Driving them to make their own campaign, and instead prompt how to invite on first campaign creation.

## Current State

Currently we are treating the tutorial game differently, in regards to invites etc.

It is currently impossible to invite a friend to the tutorial game.

![image](/uploads/348cd1efe473756d0730ce7e32f5608f/image.png)

This is causing users in the discord to feel confusion as they can't work out how to share a link, so they attempt to share the 'game' link in the address bar. The user being invited is [not greeted with a helpful error](https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/mythictable/-/issues/470) either.

## How should it look/feel?

How to Fix it?

Ideally the tutorial game should match a regular game as far as possible.
It's entirely likely that a user will run the tutorial game, and attempt to edit it into their own campaign as they learn the system.

It may be worthwhile warning, or preventing this somehow, if the intention is to continually reset the tutorial, in order to update all players with the latest changes.

They may want to run through a tutorial with a friend, if they are discovering mythic together for the first time.

So 2 options:

1. allow tutorial to invite players, and give them some other method of warning against using it as a 'real' game. (assuming we want to dis-avow 'evolving' a tutorial into a full game.

2. Do not allow tutorial campaigns to invite other players, BUT include UI in the same areas, stating that invites are disabled, and why.

## Details

- [x] TBD after Tech Spike(s)
- UX Input (Designs?)
- [x] Technical Specs Input

Currently the initial proposal is for what we think will give users an awesome FoW system to use. The current solution is actively bad ('fog' tokens), so we would like to keep these features as tight as possible to get something better into their hands. First release does not necessarily mean the end of working on FoW.

MVP - Minimun Viable Product. Fully realized feature(s) which address our goals. This should be fully polished and functional, but limited in scope.

## Steps

- [x] MVP Criteria of Completion

  - [x] Store

    - [x] Active/Inactive
  - [x] Interface
    - [x] Owner activate/deactivate FoW mode

    - [x] Owner toggles between `Obscure` and `Reveal`
  - [x] On Screen
    - [x] When active
      - [x] Click, pull, release to draw shapes.
      - [x] Owner should see the shape as it is being rendered
      - [x] Owner should be able to tell difference between `obscure` and `reveal`
      - ~~Owner should be able to cancel out of their current shape~~
    - [x] Owner should be able to see through occlusion. Non owners should not.
      - [x] Owner vision should not have the shapes overlap and darken transparency 
    - [x] All users maps should be synchronized
      - [x] FoW should survive refresh
  - Analytics
    - Is it being used? 
    - How many fog shapes are people making?
  - QA
    - Does the experience slow down at all with large numbers of fog shapes?
      - Does the above warrant doing our best to reduce the number of fog shapes?
  - Possible MVP stretch goals
    - Other shapes (initial criteria is just rectangles)
    - Keyboard shortcuts
    - [x] Hide All/Reveal All
    - Enable/Disable panning while FoW mode is active

87330854,2021-05-19 07:05:06.782,[Story] Token Visibility,"# User Story

As a DM or a token owner, I can toggle the token visibility

- [x] This visibility state is clear and recognizable 
- [x] Invisible tokens can only be seen by owning player **or with GM permissions**

## Steps

- [x] Data
  - [x] Look through token data and find where a `hidden` tag should be added.
  - ~~Make available at the `character` level so it can be `hidden` in the library~~
- [x] Permissions
  - [x] Always token owner
  - [x] With permission GM can always see as well.
    - Possibly do not make visible to GM in the library?
- [x] Tokens
  - [x] Filter through all tokens
    - [x] When `hidden` and not owner or GM without permission token is not added to canvas
    - [x] When `hidden` and owner or GM with permission render token at reduced opacity
      - [x] Add a symbol when hidden and in the library, not opacity
    - [x] Functions even if `hidden` property has not been added to `data`
      - [x] Assume not hidden
  - [x] Layer Rework
    - Scene already has to much responsibility

  - [x] Can set to `Visible` or `Hidden`
    - This is doing effectively the same work in different context
  - [x] `Visible`
    - [x] Default look
    - [x] Should be fully opaque to all users
  - [x] `Hidden`
    - [x] Should be at 50% opacity

## Acceptance Criteria (To be checked off **only** during Review)

This one has some interesting interactions, and your experience with them should be thoroughly summarized inside of Campaigns (upper left menu) > Game Master Controls.

To really get the full experience with what these are trying to do, I recommend using the incognito feature of your browser, creating a guest account and then inviting the guest account into your campaign on Edge. You can also do this with a different browser (ie: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc). Many of the features are reliant on multiple people, otherwise it (intentionally) won’t feel very different from what you could do before.

# Summary
<!--Summarize the bug encountered concisely -->
User t3rminus reported the following on Discord:
Started game.
Added a map.
Uploaded map background and set grid size.
After doing so, doing pan or zoom only the grid size was changing, not the image size.

Same result experienced in incognito mode.
User deleted the map and re-uploaded and then it worked as expected.

## Steps to reproduce

Difficult to reproduce. 

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

See summary.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Map image should expand/contract/move along with grid.

We need to fork https://github.com/crishellco/vue-unleash and maintain it ourselves

## The Problem

`vue-unleash` is no longer maintained and it requires some minor changes.

## Background/Current State

This repo provides a simple vue wrapper around the unleash client for feature flags. It provides some nice abstractions around feature flags but it needs to be updated to work with Gitlab.

## Solution

Fork this repo and implement the `instanceId`.

## Additional Information

 - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html
 - https://github.com/crishellco/vue-unleash/issues/129
 - https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-client-node


## Steps

- [x] Fork Repo to https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/libs/vue-unleash
- [x] Setup pipeline to build and publish releases
   - [x] Code Cov https://codecov.io/gl/mythicteam:libs/vue-unleash (Currently broken)
- [x] Configure Mythic Table client code to use the new release
- [x] Implement the `instanceId` header
- [x] Verify toggling feature flags works as expected.

```
npm install git+https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/libs/vue-unleash.git

Or after the package registry is set up

npm install @mythic/vue-unleash
```

Until the package registry is setup and the pipelines are set up to build you need to run a 
``` 
npm run build
```
Before each push.

## User Story

As a player I want to have a set of macro buttons accessible to me that can send saved chat messages/commands. I want to be able to check what a macro is if it isn't readily apparent. I want to be able to have it function regardless of my window size.

## Steps

- [x] Create a macro bar.
- [x] Create backend connection for persistent macros.
- [x] Connect macro bar to chat. When clicked, chat receives. 
- [x] Connect characters/tokens to backend for macros.
- [x] Enable the creation/editing/deleting of macros.
- [x] Verify they persist.
- [x] Have the macro bar update to reflect the macros of the selected token.
- [x] When token is not selected ensure user has access to standard dice. 
- [x] When token selected, token should be rendered in chat rather than user icon.
- [x] Macro bar should communicate what the macro is in some way.
- [x] If there are more macros than room on the bar, they should be added to an overflow menu.
- [x] Enable keyboard to activate any item in the macro bar.
- [x] Communicate what keyboard press will activate the macro.
- [x] User should be able to minimize macro bar. 
- [x] Macro bar should be responsive to the size of the window.
- [x] Macro bar should be aware of the sidebar.
  - [x] Macro bar should never overlap with sidebar. Possible exception on very small screens.
- [x] Macro bar should be able to adapt to very small screens. 
- [ ] Final visual pass (as passible visual updates should happen along the way).
- [ ] Tests, tests, tests.

# User Story

As a player, I want a way to easily update my player grid size/configuration

## Details

Right now the method to change the player grid configuration is cumbersome and inexact. Also there is no current way to disable the snap-to on the grid completely if needed. The intension to make the process of changing the grid square sizes easier for the user, and to make it possible to disable the grid completely

We plan to make usage of Kevin Cox's library Gridfinder to help in the calculation of grid sizing. https://gitlab.com/kevincox/gridfinder

We can use this as a guide

- https://gridfinder.kevincox.ca/?i=https%3A%2F%2Fedge.mythictable.com%2Fstatic%2Fassets%2Ftutorial%2Fbasic-map-interactions.jpg

## Steps

#### Functionality
  - [x] Add an ability to switch the scene in to ""grid finder mode"". While in gridfinder mode:
    - [x] clicking on map drops indicator (circles)
    - [x] clicking on indicator removes it
  - [x] Add a new widget to the top left of the screen with other new widgets being created that is ""Grid Manipulation Utility"" 
    - [x] Button that turns on/off the grid display entirely
    - [x] Button that turns on/off snap to grid
    - ~~The widget should have a button that clears out all custom grid intersections and resets to ""default""~~
    - ~~The grid utility will have text boxes that you can ""nudge"" or adjust the size of the grid boxes (x,y) in the case that using the gridfinder isn't giving the exact result you want~~
      - ~~Arrow keys can change number by 1 and +Shift by 10~~
    - ~~Button to turn on/off gridfinder mode~~
  - [x] Implement functionality to turn on/off grid display (Grid Manipulation Utility will hook in and trigger this)
  - [x] Implement functionality to turn on/off snap to grid (Grid Manipulation Utility will hook in and trigger this)
  - [x] With the datapoints retained in ""clicking circles"" mode above (gridfinder mode), call into the gridfinder library to derive grid sizing values and update the screen as grid sizing is calculated - The library is https://gitlab.com/kevincox/gridfinder
  - [ ] Update edge deployment to use `edge` environment for the `appName` in VueUnleash
  - [x] Update zoom functionality to be based off grid and image instead of viewport size 
  - [ ] Purge circles on map clear?
  - ~~Add offset to the Map editor window and tie into the collection data~~

#### UI
  - [x] Grid Settings Panel
    - [x] White outline on hover, no other outlining
    - [x] Theme based off of Gridfinder color
    - [x] Visual outline on screen when gridfinder active (think Slack share screen)
  - [x] Grid Finder (button in Header panel)
    - [x] Toggle switch to turn on and off
    - [x] Text and SVG follow color scheme
    - [x] ? icon which will bring up a module with gif of how to use
      - [x] Placeholder paragraph
        - [ ] Proofread by others
    - ~~On/Off display (inspire from Campaign share link UI)~~
  - [x] Snap to grid
    - [x] Toggle switch to turn on and off
    - [x] Text and SVG follow color scheme
    - ~~On/Off display (inspire from Campaign share link UI)~~
    - ~~Follow color usage of GF option On/Off~~
  - [x] Grid Visibility
    - [x] Toggle switch to turn on and off
    - [x] Text and SVG follow color scheme
  - ~~Labels Always Visible~~
    - ~~Appearance [inspired by](https://css-tricks.com/float-labels-css/)~~
    - ~~Offset X and Y~~
    - ~~Size~~
  - ~~Save Settings~~
    - ~~Implement a preview system~~
      - ~~Track both before and after~~
      - ~~Clear changes button~~
      - ~~Save button should match other save buttons UI~~
      - ~~If closed when not saved, will open modal to prompt choice~~

## QA Discoveries
  - [ ] Bugs
    - [x] `Snap to grid` and `Grid visibility` toggles will disconnect/stop working
      - [x] Reproduced In Edge
      - [x] Reproduced Locally
      - [x] Solved
    - [x] `Grid Finder Mode` cause a communication error 
      - [x] Reproduced In Edge

75081980,2020-11-27 01:57:02.664,[Improvement] Client Testing,"# Description

Currently our Client side tests are rotting.  Why is this?

- Tests couple with implementation
- Messy, difficult to understand tests
- Poor coverage
- Lack of understanding what to test
- Lack of understanding how to run tests
- Lack of understanding test well

## The Problem

Testing is extremely important. It improves confidence, enables refactoring and improves the 
speed and accuracy of development. Good tests save more time than they take.

75081929,2020-11-27 01:54:35.263,[Improvement] Client File Structure Cleanup,"# Description

The File Structure is haphazard and not intuitive.

## The Problem

It's hard to know where to find things and to know what to name new files

## Background/Current State

There were a number of people with a number of varying ideas on how to do this contributing to the project. No one agreed on anything and people just made changes as the felt.

## Solution

There are some minor changes proposed, but the biggest is the `Feature-folders`.
This change is required because we we move forward and consider break up the
application into packages, we'll do so at the feature level and hunting for
all files through a ton of `Framework-folders` would be a nightmare.

Another big change is the naming convention. 

- Vue files will be camel case `CharacterEditor.vue`
- js will be snake case `character_store.js`

74377992,2020-11-14 21:52:22.506,[Improve] Track and exploit image duplication,"# Description

Today we are allowing all file uploads to create a new representation of that file in Cloud Storage. 
This is despite the possibility that the files might be duplicate.
It would be great is we could detect the file duplication and cause the new file to reference the old file.

## The Problem

The biggest problem is bloat caused by users not understanding that they may have already uploaded a file.
There is also the possibility that some users might all have access to the same file. Admittedly this
problem might be a little less frequent.

## Background/Current State

We are storing all images that are uploaded regardless of duplication.

## Solution

- Use a MD5 index

## Additional Information

## Steps

- [x] Create a MD5 index in MongoDB
- [x] Hash the uploaded file on the server to get the MD5
- [x] Check for the duplicate and if it exists, simply return the old file object
- [x] Create a new file object and reference the image storage and url data

- It's important canceling the creation doesn't result in a character being made.

<!-- Improvement Projects are interanal initiates meant to improve code quality, tests, infrastructure or process -->

# Description

We are going to add an initcontainer that can talk to the mongodb service and tell it to allowlist the current IP.

## The Problem

Right now our k8s deployments are weak? (probably need a better word). If we delete a pod, there is a chance the service won't work because the pod won't be allocated the same IP it had before that has been allowlisted on mongodb's access control list.

## Background/Current State

Just gotta get it checked in, work is done.

## Solution

initcontainer of Jose's mongocli docker image.

# Description

What is the work we're doign and why?

## Current State

Where are we now?

""This is pretty much needed, i'm colour blind and the different token colours dont help much, also, most of my players are colorblind so adding a miriad other token shapes would be pretty nice.""
https://gitlab.com/mythicteam/mythictable/-/issues/179#note_418483500

Tokens are hard to differentiate for people with visual impairments. 

## How should it look/feel?

We should use form and texture to help differentiate token types from each-other, either by default, or have an option that can be enabled. 

We can either use the actual shape of the token, an overlay over top of the image, a small icon that is attached to it, or a combination of all of the above to indicate the type of token (swords, shields, hearts, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tokens can have an icon in the top right corner
- [x] Users can change icons
- [x] Changed icons are visible on other clients
- [x] Changed icons persist restarts
- [x] Changing a icon in the character list changes it for all tokens created from that character
- [x] Icons can be removed

Make the campaign banner have a lower maximum size and resize as the window containing it is resized.
Fit more campaigns inside a window.
Use the banner state to display more information.

50% zoom seems like a good size.

71399662,2020-09-19 20:14:28.618,[Bug] Create Campaign hangs when large images are uploaded.,"# Summary

On https://edge.mythictable.com/, when you attempt to create a campaign and use a image that's too image for the nginx 
(see issue #196) the uploading progress does not stop and you can't cancel or try a different image.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Login at edge
1. Create new Campaign
1. Choose a VERY large image

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Uploading progress never stops. 

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

We should see an error message stating the file was too large.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

See #196 

## Possible fixes

Even fixing #196 will not fix this issue.  

- [ ] The upload needs to be cancelable
- [ ] The error much be displayed
- [ ] And afterwards, a new image must be able to be selected

The Character Editor is very left-panel heavy. We need to adjust the balance of controls and inputs so that it is balanced. 


## How should it look/feel?
It should have most of the controls in the much larger right panel, with basic adjustments available on the left. 

How to Fix it?
Move the colour and frame style options over to the right panel, placed below the Description field. 
Using the grid style buttons from the Scene Editor, show previews of different frames

Moving a token to any 0 does not result in an update.

Moving a token so any of its coordinates are 0 will result in that coordinate not being updated.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Login
1. Enter tutorial
1. Drag a toke to the left most part of the map
1. Drag a toke to the top most part of the map
1. Drag a toke to the top-left part of the map

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

In each of these cases the coordinate that was suppose to be 0 is left with the original value.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- [ ] Tokens should remain where they were dropped.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

# Summary
<!--Summarize the bug encountered concisely -->
When using the Add Map tool in Edge, nothing happens after selecting the file from the file explorer dialog.

## Steps to reproduce
Produced in Chrome and Firefox from the same account on the same campaign.
- Add a new scene
- Click ""Add Map""
- Select a file larger than 1,024KB and click ""Open"" in the file explorer dialog
- Order something from amazon prime.
- Receive Amazon prime order next day.
- Verify that nothing has happened since selecting a file
- Clicking outside the dialog does not allow you to access the rest of the interface
- Hitting Escape does not allow you access the rest of the interface. 
- Can escape from Add Map dialog by uploading a file smaller than 1,024KB and selecting it.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?
Current behavior 
- forces user to upload maps smaller than 1,024KB without any notification of this limit
- forces a user to remain in the Add Map tool until uploading something smaller than the limit above
- provides no feedback to indicate that the operation of uploading has failed or is not allowed

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?
- provide notification of file size limit prior to uploading
- provide options for leaving the Add Map tool without having to upload an unwanted map
- provide feedback that an operation has failed or file is currently being uploaded

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots
<!--Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise. -->

## Possible fixes
<!-- If you can, link to the line of code that might be responsible for the problem -->
Possibly part of the default PHP upload file max limit. Unsure what method is being used for uploads but this is a common problem with default server configurations.

Going in and our of campaigns without reloading the page causes a number of state changes that lead to unexpected results.

## The Problem

We've noticed that some things aren't being loaded (players) and some things are being loaded overtop of other state such as scenes.

## Background/Current State

This is caused by the fact that we're a single page application.  We need to make sure that state is dealt with properly or we load into a new page when loading the game.
