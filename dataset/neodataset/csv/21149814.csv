117037182,2022-10-17 14:07:10.856,FE: use React 18,"update packages to use react 18:
- react
- react-dom
- react-test-renderer
- @testing-library/react"": ""^12.1.2"", -> 13
- @testing-library/react-hooks"": ""^7.0.2"", -> uninstall and import renderHook from above package
- @types/react

Make sure this branch is uptodate with master.

If possible this ticket should be splitted into smaller ones. Fix upcoming react changes separately (if possible)

TODO:

- [x] wmjsmap doesn't currently work with React 18 in Strict mode, this has to be fixed. The map view gets mounted, unmounted and not remounted. We could temporarily disable strict mode for the app until it's fixed. More info: https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#updates-to-strict-mode. Fix in separate ticket https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2957
- [x] typing in a TAF field breaks the app, try to update react-hook-form to V7 first? https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/2926 Not sure if this would fix it, maybe needs a bit more investigation.

In 5.x CSF, you would annotate a story like this:
```
export const Basic = () => <Button />
Basic.story = {
  name: 'foo',
  parameters: { ... },
  decorators: [ ... ],
};

In 6.0 CSF this becomes:
```
export const Basic = () => <Button />
Basic.storyName = 'foo';
Basic.parameters = { ... };
Basic.decorators = [ ... ];

116669689,2022-10-11 12:58:38.831,BE: investigate AWS SAM to run BE locally,"Investigate and document on whether we can use SAM to run the lambdas locally for easier testing.

Add documentation on how to use and set up

Findings:
- SAM templates are a superset of CloudFormation templates
- SAM templates can include ""transforms"" that could make the definition of serverless apps more breve
- The SAM CLI has a `sam local` command that make it possible to run your stack locally, but the number of supported services is very limited (i.e. no S3 support)
- Because of SAM's limited support I had to include LocalStack for S3 emulation
- This makes it impossible to just re-use existing CloudFormation templates, so I ended up creating new CloudFormation templates just for development, combined with Bash scripts
- LocalStack has emulation for some services as well, so I tried that too, without using SAM. CloudFormation support is very limited, so again I found myself creating a new CloudFormation template just for development, combined with Bash scripts
- It is a painful process and I didn't get a full stack working within one day - I'll stop my investigation on this now and first discuss with the backend people of the team",5

115762767,2022-09-26 08:43:13.027,BE: CPT discussion on Vulnerability vs Deployment strategical implementation,"Have a discussion with CPT on the vulnerability handling

To discuss:
1. ask CPT to decrease the vulnerability report to 7 days (instead of 21 as currently)
2. ask if possible to do a scan every day (or some other frequency that is appropriate) instead of on push only
3. Discuss our plans regarding vulnerability handling following https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/geoweb-assets/-/issues/2036


------
**Conclusions so far:**
1. It is **not possible the decrease the vulnerability report to 7 days**
- For the vulnerability report, the last image in each ECR repository is scanned
  - If in this image a vulnerability is detected, it is assumed that this vulnerability will be present in the older images in the ECR repository as well.
  - This assumption is also valid for active containers
 
2. In between vulnerability reports (every 21 days), the last uploaded ECR images are **scanned once a day** (but a lambda collects the information every hour, see below). The results of these scans are visualized in Grafana
  - DTA dashboard: https://grafana.dta.logs.knmi.cloud/
  - PRD dashboard: https://grafana.prd.logs.knmi.cloud/
  - Attached to these dashboards are alerts set for detecting critical vulnerabilities. This provides alerts in between 21 days of the report

3. After a discussion of our plans, it is discouraged to make security less strict in all pipelines. CPT prefers to have high and/or critical vulnerabilities failing the pipeline (or the thresholds)- this sends a stronger message than letting the pipeline pass & sending an alert - as it motivates developers to immediately fix the vulnerability.
  - Regarding vulnerabilities emerging during deployment to production: if vulnerabilities are found in images in development/acc, one can assume that this vulnerability will occur in all images and should be patched before going to PRD as well. 
  - Regarding sending out an alert after a vulnerability has been found during the pipeline: an alert should be sent out within 24 hours when detected via the Grafana dashboard. Therefore, setting the pipeline less strict could be an option, but it might be some additional work to send out an alert via the pipeline if it will also be detected by the Grafana dasbhoard with a short delay.

This not validated correctly in GeoWeb now.

### Wished behavior:
For FG VV000 until VV005 (ncluding VV005) are allowed.

This was done with a multimap view with 24 maps. It seemed that the GetCapabilities file was 48 times parsed for the same type of layer. (Same service and layername).

The issue seems to be in the parsing of the WMS GetCapabilities document. When line WMLayer, 1030 is commented out, the application remains fast.

It starts with ReactMapview, 399, function wmLayer.parseLayer  and WMJSMap, 1498, function layer.parseLayer. The callback will call the __parseGetCapForLayer function, which in turn will call the layerDoneCallback function. It will return a layer object with properties set based on the getcapabilities. It seems that many seconds are spend in the __parseGetCapForLayer of WMLayer. This parses the jsonified GetCapabilities file and puts certain layer properties.

**Solution**: Re-use the layer object properties for other layers, bypassing the parsing of the getcapabilities file.

**Suggestion from CPT:**

In general we should try to keep the images free of ""high"" warnings. but we can accept a few medium/low warnings. 
As a general rule it works best to keep the image as small as possible by removing not used packages. (like if there are kernel headers also to remove them as that was if I recall also once the issue.) But in some cases there is no fix and then we have to hope for a future fix.",5

Do directly in the currently used code and deploy to TST/ACC.

Improvements to be made:
- [x]  Allow resize from both bottom corners (currently you can only resize from the right corner) (https://react-grid-layout.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/17-resizable-handles.html)
- [x] Try and see if you can make it resizable from the top corners as well (https://react-grid-layout.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/17-resizable-handles.html)
- [x] Test out panels with min-width/min-height
- [x] Add a shadow indicating where the window goes to when dragging/resizing 
- [x] When adding a map - automatically scroll to the new panel

POC:
- [x] Have map panels with timeslider, multimap panel with timeslider, a (fake) timeseries
- [x] Ensure you can add a map
- [x] Each panel should be splittable and removable and resizable
- [x] Use 100% of screenwidth and height and do not allow to go over and start scrolling
- [ ] Test out panels with min-width/min-height --> not really supported (yet, there is an [open feature request](https://github.com/nomcopter/react-mosaic/issues/134)), current option is to provide a minimumPaneSizePercentage in the preset, but that is a generic property that is used for all panels in the screen.",5

=============================================

**Results:**

Someone made an overview of 10 layout libraries:
- https://morioh.com/p/6ba976ac10f6

Here is a summary for alternatives of golden layout:
- https://react.libhunt.com/golden-layout-alternatives

**Selected candidates for further research:**

1) **react-mosaic-component**: From this list react-mosaic comes very close to required behavior. The library is available on NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mosaic-component and a demo can be found at https://nomcopter.github.io/react-mosaic/ (demo).
React-mosaic has similar functionality as iterm, which was demonstrated by Mikko. The functionality of react-mosaic comes close to what the domain experts requested. It provides full usage of the screen and it allows for resizing panels by shrinking one and automatically enlarging the other. It fully supports react and it does not require jQuery which is a plus. The only drawback is that it uses react-dnd under the hood. This candidate is added to the list on https://agora.fmi.fi/display/GEOWEB/Screen+Manager+UI+Libs+PoCs

You can assign `syncGroupsIds: ['Area_satcompDust6h', 'Time_satcompDust6h'],` to both maps but this gets ignored and not set in the store.

I think the problem is caused by the following:
- the sync groups does a `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_TARGET` to add the maps to the defined syncGroupsIds as mentioned above. 
- then in the reducer it checks if the groupids are already set, they are not so nothing happens

Somehow the groupids mentioned in the preset need to be set as a group `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_GROUP` so the target maps can get set.

Proposed solution: `SYNCGROUPS_ADD_TARGET` with a non-existing group should add a group (can be done in the reducer, where there is a check for a non-existing group).",3

Meteorologist

### Short description

Currently, we're using to different services for overlays `Overlays` and `SigmetAirmetOverlays`. Pending final decisions on how to get overlays in the map, these services need to be combined.

In both services, the layer `Stations North Sea` and a the layer `Airports` exist. The different stylings in these services must be merged in one layer with multiple styling, so one `Airports` layer with two stylings; Icon and Circle. The default for each layer must be the circle (actually a circle with a centerpoint).

### Test criteria

* Open overlay service
* user can select different styles for overlay-layers (e.g. either circle or icon)
* default styling is circle

Do:
- In geoweb-adaguc, remove the sigmetairmetOverlays dataset and move the layers inside to the Overlays dataset. Ensure that the duplicate names get merged together and all styles currently available are still available but now under one and the same layer and service.",3

* In getCapabilities groups are Layer objects, probably why this is happening. 
* In the old WMSLoader, when adding service to a store through adding a layer to the map, it does work properly and serviceSetLayers action is able to add the real layers to the store.
* When layers in groups are added correctly, the groups are actually stored inside the layers ""path"" variable, but very badly, groups and subgroups are just put together to one string, without any sign of how many subgroups there are, in this example, there are 3 groups/subgroups for the layer: Fachlayer, Wetter and Warnungen 

![image](/uploads/cffd5e7af18420e89535d3b7bf7fb58b/image.png)

To fix the issue, we need to do couple things:
* Investigate why serviceSetLayers works differently in LayerSelect compared to WMSLoader and fix it in LayerSelect
* Refactor layers path variable to have better format, from which different groups can be identified clearly, I suggest renaming it to ""groups"" and having it as a array of strings
* Either Block groups from appearing in services layers array, or handle them differently by using the leaf variable, which is false for groups and true for layers",5

- Create a story with two maps

Investigation for the following:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Improve selector memoization to reduce unneccesary renders**

**Description**: Consider mapA and mapB each having a different set of layers. The issue is that changes for a layer in mapA will trigger unneeded renders of mapB. For example when you set opacity for a layer in mapA, mapB (and all other maps) is also re-rendered.

**Problem**: It seems that the getMapLayers selector causes unneeded re-rendering of components. This probably is because the layers are in one redux state object. It is probably difficult for the selector to detect which changes affect what maps.

**Solution**: Make sure that when the result of the selector is unchanged, the component does not re-render. This has to do with memoization and shallow comparison of objects.

**Hint**: From file libs/core/src/lib/store/mapStore/map/selectors.ts, 122: the selector getMapLayers is used in libs/core/src/lib/components/MapView/MapViewConnect.tsx, 86 .

nothing happens

If you first select a preset and then open the getFeatureInfo dialog it does work. Or if you first open the dialog and then manually add a layer (so not via the presets).

This is default behavor, best way is to not do this, and do the transform to uppercase elsewhere https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/7867#discussioncomment-2212314

We need to:
- remove the `toUpperCase()` in TafFormTextField
- add `textTransform: 'uppercase'` to the styling
- ~~- transform all values to uppercase on submit~~ probably can prevent this by doing this on blur
- transform all values to uppercase on blur
- let all validations handle lowercase 

To split this
- we use a lot of `trim` methods before we proceed validating. We can put this in a method that does this and do the uppercase transform. Create this method, and use this on a simple validation method so other tickets can proceed:
- test driven development, first pick a validation, and update all tests so it handles lowercase. After this fix the now failing validation methods
- after all validations are in, we can do the uppercase transforming as last and remove the uppercase in the textfield

Tip: 
- when developing remove the `toUpperCase()` in TafFormTextField, to see if the input now accepts lowercase. Later we use css to not show the lowercase

Proposed solution:
- Keep placeholders with UUID's in the database, and use these in the taflist
- Make sure that only one lambda invocation does this, develop a timed lambda which arranges the persistent UUID's
- For each new timeslot and location a new UUID will be made
- Let this lambda run every minute to check if all UUID's are given.

We need a timed lambda to ensure that only one instance is doing this.

Workflow for making a new TAF:
1) The backend provides a taflist, with persistent UUID's
2) The frontend picks one item of the taflist to edit.
3) User saves a TAF as draft with the given UUID
4) User published TAF with the given UUID
5) User cancels TAF, using the UUID. (In this case the lambda is allowed to make a new UUID?? https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/issues/993)

**ISSUES:** Because the type description of the validation field is in two different properties in the TAF object (cavOK and visibility) - the parsing for the form deviates from the way it is done for wind. I also had to adjust `parseFormValues` to be able to remove the visibility property from the object in case CAVOK has been entered. Basically because of the signature of `reduceRowValues` -> `export function reduceRowValues<T>(row: T): T` you can't remove properties from the row you passed in as the type has to be the same coming in as going out. At the same time, I could not have `parseFormValues` accept a TafFormRow type with strings only and return BaseForecast or ChangeGroup type as ""*the types don't sufficiently overlap*"". Keep in mind that if we have cavOK set to true, there should be NO visibility property in the baseforecast/changegroup that is sent to the BE and if we do have a numeric visibility - there should be NO cavOK property sent to the BE.",5

_I tried to find some information on how to “re-cancel” a TAF and what to do with the starttime of the validity of the TAF (either wallclock-hours or original).
Could not find any information on this use case. Cancelling is often used when there are no observations (e.g. during the nighttime-closure of the field) being made to review the active TAF, This is not the case in the Netherlands (at least not the civilian airports).
When these airports will open in the morning and observations are being made again,  the forecaster will start with a new TAF.
O yes, we also have a minimum duration of the TAF (should be more than 6 hours).  So de-cancelling is perhaps a non-existing use case.
That said, since a cancelled TAF must be coded as an amendment to the previous TAF, a cancelled TAF is no more than an AMD. And for AMD we do have rules, allowing to amend it again (and again, and again). So, I would allow for amending a cancelled TAF, also to avoid deadlocks if a user cancels a TAF by accident.
Than, the question on what start-time of the the TAF validity needs to have; for this, we can rely on the AMD rules, being that the end-time will stay the same as the original, but the starting time is the intended starttime of the new forecast._",5

For details on preset see userstory

### Short description

There are certain presets that are extremely useful to forecasters in combination with the ScreenManager, to show the relevant information. 

### Why 

These presets will make it easier for forecasters to work with GeoWeb and it will save them time. 

### Test criteria

* The requested presets should be available in the ScreenManager",3

90476970,2021-07-19 08:03:25.918,SpaceWeather: Make a plan on how to keep the KNMI notifications during updates of the backend database,"Have a meeting and make a plan:
- After re-ingesting Space Weather UKMO data, KNMI notifications are lost. 
- Should we save these separately for re-ingesting (coupled by UKMO notification or uncoupled ""KNMI-only"")?
- There is still a notifications database lingering around.

UKMO Notification comes in and is stored in the Incoming notification table. At KNMI this Notification is stored in the Event table and presented as an Event in the application. KNMI can add information and forward the KNMI Notification (stored in Event table) to DCC. KNMI can also make events on its own.

Note: 
- The incoming notification table is never affected by changes from KNMI, but the Event table is affected.
- The Event table contains the notification and extracted information from the notification

**Problem**: The event table should become persistent. The format of the events changes during development. How to we get the old events in the newer format? Currently we just throw away the database to prevent errors happening in the backend or frontend due to missing fields.

**Solution A**: Migrate the Event table database by using a backup/restore operation. Make a backup of the Event table and clear it. Run a restore script to add the existing events in the correct format from the backup to the table. Add a manual pipeline in the CI/CD to trigger the execution of the script. The python script is changed according to the changes to the data model. 
- Problem is that the Python code does not have strict typing of the objects, difficult to check if it will write the right format to the table. The other problem is that the Python code does not make use of a shared spaceweather library, and duplicated code might become an issue. 
- Problem is that deployment times can grow out control

**Solution B**: Make our code backwards compatible.

Suggestion: Research ticket to learn about AWS migration. Check how dynamodb tables can be backed up.

Example: For the category we needed to extract extra information from the notification. It is possible to find the right notification by the UUID.",3

It started at 14 when a new bulletin (containing 'error' in the message content) arrived and it ended around 21 when Ernst closed the SpaceWeather PRD application. 

After an investigation with CPT, the issue have been found in [logstash](https://gitlab.com/KNMI/cloud-platform/monitoring/logstash-config/-/blob/master/pipelines/knmi-geoweb/3002-filter-geoweb-backend.conf) 

The pattern `""%{GREEDYDATA:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}""`  will make log_level match as much data as possible, in regular expression this is .*, until it finds the last  - . Instead it should only match 1 word: DEBUG, so it should be set to `%{WORD:log_level}`

Suggestions from CPT:
1. You can try it out for yourself at https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ and using `DEBUG - Successful: {""message"": {""overview"": {""type"": ""ISSUED"", ""simplified_content"": ""- example with dashes - test` as input. Then you see log_level will match much more, while if you use `^%{WORD:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}$`  as pattern it doesn't. 
2. [not needed] better to use `^%{WORD:log_level} - %{GREEDYDATA:msg}$`. By adding ^ and $ to the beginning and end the pattern matching will be much easier to process for Logstash, because it knows this expression should not match something halfway the text

Investigation is needed to figure out if it is possible to customize this logger to obtain logs in the following format (that is similar to the format used in geoweb-serverless-backend):

`appType - time - level - class - message`

E.g. AviMessageConverter - 12/DEC/2021:13:14:15 Z - INFO - n.k.g.b.c.S.GeoWebSigmetToFMISigmet - GeoWebSigmetToFMISigmet convert. Error code: xxx. Line: xxx

Specification:
- **appType**: [AviMessageConverter, ...otherLibs]
- **time**: in ISO Time Format
- **level**: [INFO, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG]
- **class**: the Java class in which the log is triggered
- **message**: the log message should contain a description and the line in code in which it happens.

Part of this ticket is to apply this new format to all logs defined in geoweb-knmi-avi-messageservices (at this moment they are defined as 'log.error','log.info','log.debug','log.warn').
Off course part of this ticket is also to figure out if the current specified logs are useful or not and if are needed more logs.

NOTE: at this moment the current apache logs are in Kibana at this link
https://kibana.dta.logs.knmi.cloud/_plugin/kibana/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:now-7d,to:now))&_a=(columns:!(message),filters:!(('$state':(store:appState),meta:(alias:!n,disabled:!f,index:'ecs-apachelog-*',key:docker.container.labels.com_amazonaws_ecs_task-definition-family,negate:!f,params:(query:geoweb-backend-avi-acc),type:phrase),query:(match_phrase:(docker.container.labels.com_amazonaws_ecs_task-definition-family:geoweb-backend-avi-acc)))),index:'ecs-apachelog-*',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:avi),sort:!())

Still open questions:
1. Currently 'trace' logs are specified also (as 'log.trace'). What should we do with those?
2. Can we apply this log format also to other libraries used inside of geoweb-knmi-avi-messageservices, such as fmi-avi-messageconverter, that are slightly out of our control?",5

- Make sure you are on connect
- Go to the layermanager, check if presets are listed.

# Description

A new endpoint `viewpresetauth` was added for authenticated preset requests. The existing `viewpreset` is left unchanged. The `viewpresetauth` endpoint is useful to have, because it will give a 401 unauthorized error if no access token is provided or if something is misconfigured.

You can check https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpreset and https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpresetauth

By using the command `curl -k --location  https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud/viewpresetauth' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ....'` you can sign in from the command line.

- Nginx https, ssl and generation of self signed certs can be switched off by setting the environment variable`PRESETS_ENABLE_SSL=FALSE`. The http port can be set with `NGINX_PORT_HTTP`. Nginx should not use https by itself when it is deployed behind an AWS elastic load balancer and should only listen to HTTP.
- Nginx communicates with cognito to get user information based on the OAuth2 Bearer token send with the `viewpresetauth` request. The userinfo endpoint of the identity provider can be set via the `OAUTH2_USERINFO` environment variable.
- For CORS, nginx needs to know the domain of the frontend. This needs to be set with the `FRONTEND_APP_URL` environment variable.
- Nginx sets the ""Geoweb-Username"" header for the flask presets backend
- An endpoint is deployed at https://gwpresetsbe-dev-check-auth.geoweb.dev.knmi.cloud (only accessible via connect). 

The cognito userinfo endpoint and the location of the frontend are configured from CI/CD via the OAUTH2_USERINFO and FRONTEND_APP_URL variables. These have been set for dev, tst, acc and prd.

# Solved Issues

- Nginx in the ECS cluster will talk via the KNMI squid proxy with gitlab or cognito. Squid has some quirks, therefore only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 can be used. (Only TLSv1.3 icm gitlab). 
- The EC2 load balancer uses by default the http/2 protocol. When running http/2, it changes all HTTP headers which are forwarded to nginx to lowercase. Disabling http/2 solves this issue. Nginx expect the authorization header to be `Authorization` with strict casing (not `authorization`)
- Because of CORS, the frontend and the backend needs to match domains. Therefore FRONTEND_APP_URL must be configured, which is the location of the GeoWeb Frontend.
- In the ECS cluster, nginx needs to be accessed via HTTP. It should be started without the self signed HTTPS certificate. It is now possible to switch this off and run nginx over http. For HTTPS, the Elastic Load Balancer will do the HTTPS offloading and handle the SSL certificates. This can be switched off in nginx by setting the environment variable `PRESETS_ENABLE_SSL=FALSE` and setting the `NGINX_PORT_HTTP` environment variable.

for example:

const clonedGeoJson = _cloneDeep(dataNoHightlight)\
const editedGeoJson = clonedGeojson.find()...\
setDataInUse(editedGeoJson)

This should set show hightlights on map and switch hightlights between clicking polygons, while leaving dataNoHighlight untouched

# Discussion

We can fix this in the backend or in the frontend (or both). The frontend could be made less strict. The backend could add the correct unit.

# Solution:

Make the frontend less strict for detecting the time dimension.

In https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/blob/master/libs/webmap/src/lib/components/WMJSDimension.ts#L246:

Change 

```
if (this.units === 'ISO8601') {
```
 to

```
if (this.units === 'ISO8601' || this.name === 'time') {
```

# How to test

Combine with `getAllowedUnits` so you call that one with the productConfig passed in and it extracts the requested allowed units for your form-field directly. 

~~Regarding `useProductSettings` as a hook idea, it would be nice to have 1 file that has all values calculated so we don't do it too much, but doing this would make a new provider needed. All Field components now have the productConfig prop, with a provider prop drilling would not be needed. This involves a lot of file and test changes. Currently a lot of methods do a simple thing, and I think that's the way to go for now. If in the end we still want this hook idea, we could do it easier as we have all small methods ready to use in 1 go.~~",2

119159979,2022-11-22 08:33:10.798,BE: Update openapi specs for TAF,"An issue reported by Marcel brought forward the following problem: in the openapi specification a validation case is missing where the change group contains _only_ a ""probability"" field and **not** a ""change"" field. 


#### What should be done?
Currently, the ""change"" field is set as required. An additional validation case should be created where the ""probability"" field is required and should have a value of ""PROB30"" or ""PROB40"" and the ""change"" field may be left empty.


#### Requirements
The changegroup below should be accepted by the openapi specification. In a change group:
1. The field ""change"" is not empty, the field ""probability"" may be empty
2. The field ""probability"" is not empty, the field ""change"" may be empty
3. Both may be not empty
4. At least one of the two should have a value


#### Example

118137765,2022-11-04 10:50:44.607,FE: investigate firefox container query polyfill issue,"### User

Developers, users
### Short description
Investigate why firefox is breaking on the build (it is working locally) with using the container-query polyfill. Test this on the build to make sure staging won't break again. 


### Why
So we can use container queries in firefox and have a uniform view

### Test criteria
- firefox should not cause blank screen in build
- firefox should work with container queries

### Extra information
A MR is already open with moving the polyfill to the `polyfills` file, but that did not work and gave a blank screen as well. Maybe include it with cdn link somehow?",3

Tests are getting sometimes a timeout sometimes now because it takes a long time (also in pipeline), and redux warnings appear in tests for non redux components.

```
const ThemeWrapperWithModules: React.FC<ThemeProviderProps> = withEggs([

  <ThemeWrapper theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeWrapper>

There are several configurations that depend on the selected FIR for example:

* validation of valid from/to
* validation of cloud/level/movement/wind speed min max and rounding
* units displayed in the dropdowns
* surface wind + surface visibility min/max

When changing the selected FIR the untis are displayed correctly (they get added or removed accordingly) but the validation is not retriggered. So if you add a valid value for one FIR, then change the FIR (for which the value is invalid) there is no error showing. Not even when going in to the field and blurring. I'd say this is not MVP but probably something we should keep in mind.

Currently these are served directly from a S3 bucket, as static website. It seems dat the expiration time is not set for this way of serving. Without expiration time, the tiles are fetched unnecessary often.

A benefit of adding an expiration time, is that the map view experience will probably be more smooth. By using tiles with an expiration time the map will display with less loading and flickering.

To enable expiration time, we need to serve the static tiles behind cloudfront. Serving via cloudfront is also considered best practice by AWS.

Fix by removing storyName from .parameters and defining it separately

114834453,2022-09-12 07:34:34.083,BE: 400 error returned when opening some notifications for spaceweather,"### Summary

Sometimes when opening a spaceweather notification from the list you get a 400 error. The error returned from the BE (not shown in the dialog): `Error while retrieving event: event not found` and error logged: `Error in PRD grafana: 2022-09-08 10:06:16 Error while retrieving event from the events table: Event not found. Line 386`

### Steps to reproduce

Open several notifications in the list until you get a 400 error. It seems to happen quite frequently so no need to open a lot before it happens.

### Possible fixes

From Ernst:

> I did a quick scan of this problem: it probably is caused by the DynamoDB sometimes returning 0 items for a query, but also telling you to request more results because the query has not finished yet. This surfaces only now because the eventtable has grown above a certain size. We've had similar problems with other queries and fixed all queries, but apparently missed this one. It probably could happen with any type of notification.

Result: opening notifications in the FE should no longer lead to 400 errors - really hard to test in the dev branch as there is not a large database there. Test in dev branch it works as expected and verify once deployed to tst.",3

Update code to accomodate this new version

----
What has been done:
* Tried to use new debian version `bookworm`
  * No official python version with bookworm is available: https://hub.docker.com/_/python
  * So I tried to use `debian:bookworm` and install python in that image
  * This did **not** work as this image could not be scanned on AWS (see [this](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories/private/568951685059/gitlab/pipeline-scan/image/sha256:4f1ab5d9e4d96bad163ef2b4c4f1add90da6b85f82ffffed58618070dade9a4f/details/?region=eu-west-1))
* Tried to use a newer python version with the same debian version
  * `python:3.10.6-slim-bullseye` instead of `python:3.9-slim-bullseye`. (During refinement it was agreed to use a newer version of python)
  * Additionally, tried to use a fixed version of the vulnerable package db5.3 which was released for `bookworm`
  * This still marked the package as vulnerable
 
**Conclusion:**
* Vulnerability is still marked as high, so the decision was made to whitelist the vulnerable package
* The new version of python will be kept (python 3.10 instead of 3.9)
* It seems now that the only way to fix this vulnerability is waiting until a python image with `bookworm` is released
* In the end, only this [MR](https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/backend-services/presets-backend/-/merge_requests/49) has to be merged (with new python version). The 2nd MR mentioned was created to deploy the dev branch of the presets-be and pass the vulnerability scanning. A third MR (https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/geoweb-serverless-backend/-/merge_requests/332) can be cleaned up. This one was used to deploy the serverless BE in order to test the dev branch in a local FE.

#### Intro:
After all micro-services in the TAF BE have been set up, we should review the CPU and memory allocated for each instances.

During deployment of dev-branches, sometimes an issue was encountered that insufficient CPU or Memory was available in the container instances in the KNMI cluster. Therefore, the CPU and memory was decreased for all services.

With everything set up, review the current settings and see where CPU and/or memory should be decreased or increased. Compare this with the availability in the cluster. Or try another approach

#### Latest configuration:
Please note, instead of this configuration, now the entire task was given 1 CPU and 1 GB to share in between. But before that, CPU & memory were divided like (you can check out cloudformation!):

| Container | CPU | Memory | Temp   |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| admin  |  .25   |  256   |  yes   |
| tafbe  |  .25   |  256   |  no    |
| nginx  |  .25   |  256   |  no    |
| avimsg |  .25   |  256   |  no    |
| placeh.|  .125  |  256   |  no    |
| publish|  .125  |  256   |  no    |
| total-1 |  1.25 CPU | 1.5GB  |  yes   |
| total-2 |  1 CPU  | 1.25GB  |    no    |

1=total of all containers including temporary admin
2=total of ""final"" status

#### Example of issue:
![image](/uploads/02aaec9ec4d249f62b53623b51c34ccd/image.png)

1. const validationRules = {

2. and add null check on parseInput

check that the required: true validation still works for each scenario

check that it will send NaN

It is possible to drag on the dialog content instead of only on the header.
Only happens on the first render, or after closing and opening the dialog. Possibly a thing of the library

**Possible solution**:
1. Move Drag/Size component to a separate component, so it's getting unmounted when it's closed/open
2. Register the dragHandle as ref, and make a `useEffect` to trigger a rerender. Can be without the ref, but this makes it more clear why we do this.

So it should be possible to toggle the Moveable dialog with a custom button.

Possible solution would be to get the whole isOpen state out of the Moveable component, and let that component only return an onClose (Don't unmount the Moveable fully, because then it will loose the lastPosition state).  Dummy code:
```
const Demo = () => {
  const [isLegendOpen, toggleLegendOpen] = React.useState(true);

In this issue the goal is to make it work for only the action `WEBMAP_LAYER_CHANGE_NAME`. This is to test the feasibility of the implementation using SyncGroups. This involves creating a new syncgroup type LAYER next to the two existing BBOX and TIME types. Demonstrate that it works with **a new** MultiMap preset.

* Copy the Precipitation, pressure and wind preset and make a similar one but with one master layer manager, so it’s easy to compare both types of preset. Names can be `Harmonie precipitation, pressure and wind 1:1` and `Harmonie precipitation, pressure and wind 1:all` respectively

95797636,2021-10-20 13:32:06.771,IWXXM lib should fix OBS time before start time,"According to Annex 3 it is legal to set the observation time of a SIGMET or AIRMET phenomenon to a time before the start of SIGMET/AIRMET's validity time. 
IWXXM-3.0 validation, however does not allow this. 

_I ran into a small problem with SIGMET/AIRMET  and the optional time for the OBS/FCST when implementing IWXXM3.0:
In the FE the OBS or FCST time is optional, that is fine. The OBS time can be (slightly) before the starting time of the SIGMET/AIRMET, as ICAO has specified rather vaguely. The FCST time should be in the valid period. These things are validated in the FE.
It turns out that for IWXXM there is a rule which states that the OBS time should be inside the valid period (which boils down to OBS time == VALIDSTART). Generating IWXXM's with OBS time before VALIDSTART fails on the IWXXM validation.
This is a problem in IWXXM3.0, which will be fixed in the upcoming version, but we're still stuck on 3.0.
See also: https://github.com/wmo-im/iwxxm/issues/208
This means that with the current state of the FE we can produce SIGMET/AIRMET's that can not be converted to IWXXM3.0.
Possible solutions would be to:
build the same validation into the FE: OBS time should be equal to start of VALID TIME (result would end up in both TAC and IWXXM)
when generating the IWXXM always change the OBS time to the valid time start (result would only show up in IWXXM and forecasters would never see it, because in the TAC it remains unchanged)_",3

- if possible add a test


### Summary

During the drawing (when in drawing mode) the lat/lon positioner in the left down corner does not work. The position of the mouse is only given, when the user is not in drawing mode. 
This however should also work IN drawing mode

This is necessary, because sometimes areas from other messages (VAAC (Volcanic Ash advisory) https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/transport/aviation/regulated/vaac/advisories ) have to be used, which consist of coordinates. Good examples can be found in the archive in may 2011
Then it is quite inconvienent if the positionidentification does not work.

### Steps to reproduce

When the user is in drawing mode (f.e. box or polygon), the location identification should give the lat/lo location of the mouse, so the user knows at which coordinates the user is putting the points. 


### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The position identificiation does not work and only gives the lat//lon of the start of the drawing.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

When the user is in drawing mode (f.e. box or polygon), the location identification should give the lat/lo location of the mouse, so the user knows at which coordinates the user is putting the points. 

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

For making a SIGMET or AIRMET often the same datalayers are necessary. It is convenient for the user, if they are all in 1 preset for SIGMET and AIRMET, so he can open them at once and select the ones he needs by making them vissible or not vissible with the layer manager.

The SIGMET/AIRMET preset contains the following datalayers:
- Radar: Reflectivity (dBZ)
- Radar: precipitation NL
- Satellite: HRVComb
- Satellite: RGB Vulkaanas
- Obs wind
- obs gust
- obs weather code
- obs cloudbase
- obs MOR
- Harm windflags
- Harm gusts
- Harm T
- Harm precip
- Harm Neso
- Harm cloudbase

The layers in the layermanager should be in this order.

To make the loading faster, best to have them not vissible, except for Radar precip NL and satellite HRVComb.

### Why 

To make it more easy for the user to get the usefull data for a SIGMET

### Test criteria

* When the user chooses the SIGMET and AIRMET preset
  * then this preset opens, with all layers available, whereoff only precip NL and HRVComb are switched on vissible.",3

- The screen should be configurable with a json file like in https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/merge_requests/612. 
- It should be possible to specify which component should be rendered at which location on the screen with a configuration file
- Check if golden-layout provides handles / feedback / callbacks to get status updates when positions/sizes of components are changed. These can then be stored back in the preset 
- The screenmanager code should be decoupled from a specific layout manager like golden-layout, in such a way that it remains possible to switch to another layout manager without getting into trouble.
- Next to golden-layout, React-Grid will be tested for needed functionality
- How well does the library functions with material design?
- Opening new browser tabs?
- Tooling (icons) for closing, moving, dragging elements on screen?
- Final result is POC in storybook

### User

Developers

### Short description

Upgrade react hook form from 6 to 7

### Why 

So we are up to date, and we can later more easily for example split the date input

### Test criteria

Everything form related should still work as before


### Extra information
* It will break. Read upgrade instructions here https://react-hook-form.com/migrate-v6-to-v7/
* Some (dirty) fixes can be fixed in a good way in v7, [check this MR](https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/merge_requests/1147) for example for the focus issue of `insert`
* old attempt https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/merge_requests/601/diffs",3
87282909,2021-05-18 13:03:15.676,FE: Level Between Unit validation,"This task is for both SIGMET and AIRMET.

At this moment for the level all combinations of unit for Upper and Lower levels are accepted.

FLnnn/nnn or
TOP FLnnn or

[nnnn/]nnnnM (or [[n]nnnn/][n]nnnnFT) or [nnnnM/]FLnnn
(or [[n]nnnnFT/]FLnnn)

TOP [ABV or BLW] FLnnn

So this means (in order lower/upper):
- FL

https://gitlab.com/opengeoweb/opengeoweb/-/blob/master/libs/core/src/lib/geoweb-webmap/WMImage.ts#L20

If no images are loading, this counter should be zero. In practice, this counter slowly increases. The effect is that only one image can be loaded in parallel at some point. This slows animations down.

The other thing is that it might be better to leave this functionality to the browser. Nowadays the browser does probably a better job at throttling than custom JS code.

Fix: Remove this throttling mechanism or make it work properly.",5

* understand the current CI/CD pipeline
* investigate and propose alternative deployment ways

**Suggestions**

- There's a lot of repetition in the CFN template. By using a tool like [troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) we could reduce the number of line and make it easier to maintain. Default values are specified only once. First step in the pipeline would be generating the CFN template from a Python script, followed by the usual linting and deployment. We would also get rid of the `sed` replacement in the current template.
- Investigate alternatives (like [stacker](https://stacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) and [cdk](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)) for managing CFN templates.
- The end-goal could be to have completely separate deployments for frontend, Aviation, SpaceWeather, Cognito. To reach this goal we could take the following path:
   1. Extract monitoring (Grafana) and move to separate repository.
   1. Extract Cognito userpool generation (for tst, acc, prd) to the newly created [dev-cognito-userpool repository](https://gitlab.com/KNMI/geoweb/backend-services/dev-cognito-userpool) like has been done for dev.
   1. Create separate deployment repository for frontend and point to backend services.
   1. Create separate code repository and deployment repository for each backend services (Aviation, SpaceWeather), one at a time.
   1. Optional: create separate deployment repository for triggering deployment pipelines of all the components. In this repo dependencies are managed. Or could this just be the responsibility of the frontend deployment?

**To be discussed**

How do we manage dependencies and rollbacks? We currently have the possibility to deploy the complete stack from a previous tag. This could become more difficult.

How do we connect the different stacks? By exporting output values and importing those in another stack. This makes the importing stack dependent on the exporting stack, meaning the latter cannot be deleted without deleting the first. (We have to investigate if updates are problematic.) Or we use `aws cloudformation describe-stacks` inside CI/CD for looking up exported output values and pass those as parameters through the properties files created in .gitlab-ci.yml. The benefit is that stacks can be deleted independently.",5
