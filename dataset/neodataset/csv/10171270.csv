### Summary

Notifications close when you select a notification - this was intended behavior for mobile devices, but I think decreases the usability of notifications for desktop. If possible this should still be applied to mobile notifications.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open notifications
2. Click one
3. Menu has closed

### Platform information 

Cross-platform web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The window closes after selecting a notification - have to re-open and scroll down.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

You should still see the window after clicking one.

A few issues here varying in severity:

* A previously valid number from the UK is no longer valid.

* if country code is above two characters, the number field is returned with part of the country code, and the end is truncated. e.g.

`(+44) 12345678`
becomes
`(+1) 41234567 `

### Steps to reproduce

1. Log-in.
2. Go to `Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication`.
3. Try to enter a UK number (+44)

### Platform information 

Cross-platform web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

### Summary

When you finish re-keying your password, most of the time it seems not to close the change window, and just resets it, leaving you unsure that it worked.

### Steps to reproduce

Looks like you can't remove your only bank account from wallet/cash 

### Steps to reproduce

Add a bank account to wallet/cash and try to remove it

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

You see an error notice 
### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

You should either be able to remove your bank account, or the 'remove' link should not be visible when you have only one bank account. For multiple bank accounts, it seems like there will have to be a way to reset the 'default_for_currency' param if you want to remove your default bank account.

Original scope:

The media modal needs to load all of our entities - video, images, blogs, activities

When we're loading the modal pager from a url directly, the modal pager needs to move left and right through the channel who owns the content.

Add left and right arrows to the media view, loading the appropriate feed.

If the user loads the media view from the feed, the left and right arrows should swipe through the news feed

If the user loads the media view from the channel feed, the left and right arrows should swipe the the channel feed

If the user loads the media view from the group feed, the left and right arrows should swipe through the group feed.

# Note - this is a bug in an epic branch and not in production 

### Summary

It seems as if the full amount deposited in the SKALE community pool cannot be withdrawn - it is requiring I leave a certain amount in or the transaction fails - I've contacted the SKALE team to ask them about this.

### Steps to reproduce

Try to withdraw 100% of your funds from the community pool.

### Platform information 

Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Some Ether has to be left in the pool/

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

A user would expect to be able to withdraw everything in the pool.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

In order to more effectively communicate the goals and the value of the Build Your Algorithm compass tool, we should change some of the copy that appears in the newsfeed placement, as well as the modal view of the BYA tool.

For reference, this is the newsfeed placement:

![image](/uploads/1cc92dfeeaa2cd8dd7bb4654f63282f5/image.png)

This is the modal view of the core BYA component:

## Current language:

Newsfeed component:
- Build your algorithm
- Set your echo chamber preferences

Modal view:
- Build your algorithm
- The preferences you set will improve your recommendations over time as the open source machine learning monkeys evolve. Don't worry, it won't impact your default newsfeed.

## Desired language:

Newsfeed component:
- Build your algorithm
- The preferences you set will improve your recommendations

Modal view:
- Build your algorithm
- The preferences you set will improve your recommendations over time as the open source machine learning monkeys evolve. Don't worry, it won't impact your default newsfeed. [Learn more.](https://www.minds.com/minds/blog/build-your-algorithm-phase-1-1317916094152839188)

## Acceptance criteria:

- Given a user is logged into Minds,
- and the user has not already dismissed or completed the Build Your Algorithm survey,
- then the Build Your Algorithm prompt should appear at the top of the newsfeed,
- and the language used should match the language described under ""Desired language"" above.
---
- And when the user clicks into the Build Your Algorithm newsfeed component,
- then the BYA modal component appears,
- and the language used should match the language described under ""Desired language"" above.

### Summary
In relation to a discussion that both @ottman, myself and several other community members had within the #canary:minds.com Chat room today (20211215 - re: below URL), it is considered that the ""echo chamber"" phrasing within the ""build your algorithm"" banner subheading which is displayed within the Newsfeed section is inappropriate and could be considered as being a form of poor public relations.

There has been a couple suggestions to replace the ""set your echo chamber preferences"" phrasing, these include:

* Set your social sphere preferences
* Adjust your playground preferences
* Set your safety bubble preferences
* Set your unique personal preference
* Control your content preferences 
* Set your personally directed content curation preferences
* Manage your news and content preferences
* Adjust newsfeed algorithm to your personal preferences

(Note: further suggestions maybe added to this ticket depending on community feedback.)

98962984,2021-12-13 17:59:39.060,Metamask logo missing in web3modal,"### Summary

@fausto.arci and @ottman have both noticed that when onboarding your wallet, until you refresh or restart the browser, the web3 modal does not show the Metamask logo - my suspicion is that this happens when `window.web3` is not found.  

### Steps to reproduce

* Open a browser without metamask
* Try to connect your wallet
* Observe no Metamask logo - clicking will link you to download Metamask

### Platform information

Replicated Chrome / Windows

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

No Metamask logo is visible in the web3 modal.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should see Metamask image, probably be warned that you need to refresh / reload your browser if possible.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![image](/uploads/de50cdcaabf5bd648a0bcb4cb6275666/image.png)

### Possible fixes

All of the above explanation is speculation, but it seems likely that `window.web3` not being injected is the cause. You can test this by typing it in a browser console.

See: https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5186#note_771943279 for an idea",5

### Build out our own TX encoder 

Check if the below code works for all dynamic params, if it does, we can probably use it - would need to support types other than string though.

```
   public function encodeContractMethod($contractMethodDeclaration, array $params)
    {
        // Method Signature: first 4 bytes (8 hex digits)
        $contractMethodSignature = substr($this->sha3($contractMethodDeclaration), 0, 8);

        $contractMethodParameters = '';

        foreach ($params as $param) {
            if (is_array($param)) {
                if ($param['type'] === 'string') {
                    // first part of encoding - encoding the offset to the param
                    $offset = strlen($contractMethodParameters);
                    $offsetHex = dechex($offset);
                    $encodedOffsetSection = str_pad($offsetHex, 64, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
                    $contractMethodParameters .= $encodedOffsetSection;
                    
                    $paramLength = strlen($param['value']);
                    $paramLengthHex = dechex($paramLength);
                    $encodedParamLengthSection = str_pad($paramLengthHex, 64, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
                    $contractMethodParameters .= $encodedParamLengthSection;
                    
                    $parameterHex = bin2hex($param['value']);
                    $paramSection = str_pad($parameterHex, 64, '0', STR_PAD_RIGHT);
                    $contractMethodParameters .= $paramSection;

                    $x = 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (strpos($param, '0x') !== 0) {
                    throw new \Exception('Ethereum::call only supports raw hex parameters');
                }

                $hex = substr($param, 2);
                $contractMethodParameters .= str_pad($hex, 64, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);    
            }
        }

        return '0x' . $contractMethodSignature . $contractMethodParameters;
    }

### Summary

Onchain transfer amounts are not rounded down enough, leading to some layout-breaking amounts. 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Login to an account that has made withdrawals, ideally for amounts with many decimal points. If not you can probably edit the DOM to achieve the same effect. 
2. Go to https://www.minds.com/wallet/tokens/transfers

We need to ensure there are no provider conflicts, and our site is aware of changes to the current network in the provider - network changes should be subscribable through code such as below:

```
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum, ""any"");
    provider.on(""network"", (newNetwork, oldNetwork) => {
        // When a Provider makes its initial connection, it emits a ""network""
        // event with a null oldNetwork along with the newNetwork. So, if the
        // oldNetwork exists, it represents a changing network
        if (oldNetwork) {
           // handle - reload or update UI
        }
    });
```

When doing this we need to ensure that onsite network switches are not picked up in the above logic.

We should investigate also whether we can use the current browser provider as the sole way to change the local state's network variable, rather than having to track it in a separate variable locally and update it as we go.",8

### Summary

Sporadically the boost rotator appears to either load incredibly slowly, or not at all. The behavior varies from browser to browser.

### Steps to reproduce

* Load newsfeed (with boosts turned on, if you are Plus)

### Platform information 

* For me, Firefox consistantly has slow loading issues
* For John, Brave sometimes outright does not load the rotator.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Slow load / rotator not loading.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Rotator should load smoothly with the rest of the inline boost feed.

- [x] Implementation of the designs

### Known issues
* It is easy to miss posts that were publish since the users last visit
* Multiple successive posts can at time drown out other newsfeed items
* Revisiting the newsfeed within the same user session displays the same content again and again
* It may be demotivating for a user if the first items they see are not as interesting as they could be

### Query Logic

FYI @markeharding - My think was that we could display the top three posts, that a user has not yet seen, or if this is not possible, a randomised top three posts. This would remain cached for a period of time, say around 5 - 10 mins. Once the cache has expired, the query would run again and new posts displayed.",20

90157272,2021-07-12 23:08:37.931,Address how boost impressions are currently being displayed,"### Notes

* Currently the post boost rotator is displayed as the first item in the newsfeed
* Placing it in the first position could be deemed as somewhat intrusive, as the first item in the newsfeed should ideally be something known / useful.
* It is feared that moving the rotating boost feed down into second place could result in fewer impressions overall.
* The the above was indeed the case, how could we further increase the overall number of impressions throughout the UI.
* Channel boosts are displayed only in one place (newsfeed sidebar) where there tends to be none displayed, or too many displayed. Could we widen where boosted channels are displayed.
* Possible to widen where sidebar post boosts are displayed? Currently this appears really to be in only one place.

### Summary

[\@SpinFlight ](https://minds.com/SpinFlight/) reports

Value is hardcoded to ""Minds tokens"" - so if a user purchased ETH, the modal incorrectly tells them they purchased MINDS.

https://gitlab.com/minds/front/blob/afa6554acd816dddc8176b7ca8386a841f54ae6c/src/app/modules/blockchain/token-purchase/v2/order-received/order-received-modal.component.html#L7

### Steps to reproduce

Make order through Transak and buy ETH

### Platform information 

Probable to be platform-agnostic for web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Incorrect currency shown

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Can we grab the currency purchased back from Transak? If we cannot we should remove the amount.

### Summary

It appears that the paywall is not working for blogs, when set within the blog posting screen its self. You can set the paywall and it will work if you do it by editing the post on your newsfeed however.

NOTE: Canary mode is turned on.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new blog
2. Add a title, upload a banner image and type ""test"" in the content input field.
3. Click the ""Paywall"" button and put the blog behind a 1 token paywall.
4. Click ""Publish"".
5. Log out and log into a different account which has never wired tokens to the first account.

5. Log out and log into a different account which has never wired tokens to the first account.
6. Open the blog posted by the first account.
7. Click ""Unlock"".

### Platform information

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Paywalls within blogs don't work. Users who have never wired tokens to you can unlock the paywall which can be set within a blog.

9. Click ""View More"".
10. Click on the thumbnail for the image.

### Platform information 

* Windows 10 / Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86)
* replicated Manjaro / Chromium

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

When you post an image, video or blog and then put it behind a paywall, it is still visible in your image/video/blog gallery for other users.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

If you put an image/video/blog behind a paywall after you already posted it to your channel, it shouldn't be visible and accessible to users who do not meet the paywall threshold for that content. Either that or it should appear for other users but behind the paywall mask and I think both you and other users should be able to filter the image/video/blog gallery by paywalled content. Perhaps just add a button called ""Exclusive Content"" at the top of each gallery.

2. Click the edit button.
3. Click the ""Hashtags"" button.
4. Click on a hashtag.

### Platform information 

Windows 10 / Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86)

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

When selecting hashtags for your channel from the existing ones it jumps to the bottom of the list.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It shouldn't jump to the bottom of the list.

--->

### Summary

I think this might have something to do with the new search/discovery update. What is the difference between the ""SEARCH POSTS"" button and the ""SEARCH MINDS"" button? I'm pretty sure the ""SEARCH POSTS"" button used to display posts which contain the search term(s) in the title or description and the ""SEARCH MINDS"" button displayed a list of channels which have the search term(s) in their display names or usernames. Currently the ""SEARCH MINDS"" button seems to be doing what the ""SEARCH POSTS"" button used to do while the ""SEARCH POSTS"" button is broken.

It may be that the ""SEARCH POSTS"" feature has been removed and replaced with the ""SEARCH MINDS"" button but if so, it should no longer be appearing in the search drop down menu.

NOTE: Canary mode is turned on.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the newsfeed.
2. Type ""test"" into the search box and click the ""SEARCH POSTS"" button.

### Platform information 

Windows 10 / Chrome (Version 73.0.3683.86)

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The ""SEARCH POSTS"" button in the search drop down menu doesn't work. It just loads Top --> All no matter what you search for.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Option 1: The ""SEARCH POSTS"" button in the search drop down menu should display all public posts which contain the search term(s).

Option 2: It may be that the ""SEARCH POSTS"" feature has been removed and replaced with the ""SEARCH MINDS"" button and if so, it should no longer be appearing in the search drop down menu.

### Summary

@authorpendragon 
>  I tried to post this in Canary ""Bug Report"" but Canary ""Bug Report"" does not allow screenshots, i.e. proof of replication! You need a slot for screenshots.

As can be seen above the user reports that after editing a blogs post, their image has gone. 

### Steps to reproduce

There are two bugs here that I believe may well be related:

Original bug:
> Here's a screenshot of an original graphic/clickthrough that has an UNEDITED introduction. What happens to it after an EDIT of the introduction is SAVED is recorded in the first comment box: the graphic or clickthrough disappears. I have had this happen on multiple posts. The only remedy is to delete and repost.

* Make a new blog post with a banner image
* Publish it
* Go to your newsfeed or profile
* Edit the post

![2](/uploads/8efb8dce17d609187d650a6155433713/955512905215991808.jpeg)

Another likely related issue:
* Make a new blog post with a banner image
* **DO NOT LEAVE THE PAGE**
* Try to edit the post and save
* Observe that even though you can see a banner image, you cannot save without reuploading

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ad4VBVu.png)

### Platform information 

Chromebook, Mac Air/High Sierra/Firefox 

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The user cannot edit their blog post without losing the image associated with it and having to recreate.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Editing should not get rid of the image in either scenario.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Several users are complaining that their image gallery widgets are disappearing from their channel sidebar despite having at least one image in their image galleries. And many of their recently uploaded images are not appearing in their image gallery for some reason.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The image gallery widget should always be visible even if the channel hasn't uploaded any images and all the images the user has ever uploaded should be listed in the image gallery.

### Notes

* The emoji component is a requirement only for web (not a requirement for mobile)
* Users can access recently used emojis. Where there are no recently used emojis, this section will not display.
* Emojis are arranged by the following categories: Recently User, Smileys & People, Animals & Nature, Food & Drink, Travel & Places, Activities, Objects, Symbols, Flags
* When activated, the search input should be focused.
* The menu position should adapt appropriately, depending on its position within the viewport. If there's little space under the emoji action, the menu should appear above. Where there's little space on RHS, the menu should be shirted towards the lift. I believe the channel card popover users Popper JS, would could be useful here -> https://popper.js.org/
* It's probably not necessary to display the emoji icon on responsive mobile. Perhaps it could be included as an option within the ellipsis menu. -> https://www.sketch.com/s/5c6ca256-987d-4698-a4aa-dbaf0b3e1c2e/v/oLzJP0/a/pam7AxJ

### Summary

As pointed out by @Quitejane, It appears that users are not able to translate certain posts. 

### Steps to reproduce

Visit one of the following links:

https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/968162515995418624

https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/968161245115498496

Hit translate.

### Platform information 

(Browser, device, system stats, screen size)

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Text is not translated into the chosen language.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Text should be translatable

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![Wire_2019-04-25_at_16.18.59](/uploads/d8f97b8d4b2278b31c411a77531123b2/Wire_2019-04-25_at_16.18.59.png)

### Possible fixes

As you can see above I cannot replicate this by posting a simple post in Español/Spanish. The translate works fine. Also repeated this for Deutsch/German and got the same results.

So I'd presume there is a common factor linking the two example posts above. One of them has a 'Clover' character that could be messing things up, the other doesn't really appear to have any special characters (plenty of non-English but all pretty standard characters) but is long.

I wonder whether there's an error being thrown and not being reported.

### Summary

If after sending an on chain offer, you decide to revoke it, the web app currently does not call upon MetaMask to confirm a transaction, but writes to Cass as if it has, leaving the tokens in the contract ready to be collected by the user.

### Steps to reproduce

# IMPORTANT: If you do this, you will lose tokens unless you are going to manually sign a transaction to the contracts revoke function

1. Send an on chain boost
2. Revoke it  
3. Observe MetaMask does not pop up but you no longer have the option to revoke the post.

### Platform information 

Universal (Web app) 

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The on chain tokens are never actually retrieved from the blockchain when hitting the button

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

MetaMask should pop up, and only if the transaction is successful should the data be written.

### Summary

@FretzCapo

>Groups are resolving to chat instead of posts by default from the Groups Bar, on all mobile browsers ios iPhone xr newest build

> It's inconsistent. This group loads on the feed automatically for me, others continuously load on the chat. Makes no rhyme or reason. I have found that on iphone I just hold and pull down the feed will load. This is only in browsers and not in the app, btw.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a group called GROUP CHAT DEFAULT, and set the default view to chat.
2. Create the counterpart FEED CHAT DEFAULT and set the default chat to feed.
3. Click between the two groups, observe and scroll down.

### Platform information 

reported for iPhone Xs iOS 12.2 in Safari. 
tested S7 edge - Android 8.0.0 in Brave.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

It's hard to tell because there is one issue masking things a bit, where it seems if the default is set to feed, it shows the chat until you scroll down.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The default view should just be the one loaded.

### Summary:

'Boost' notifcations usually carry a link to the post. When this post doesn't exist, the notification still comes through. 
This results in all the notifications prior being erased, making the new notifications unresponsive and rendering the rest of the website unresponsive.

The notifications below the unassigned boost notification become empty, and the website becomes seemingly unresponsive, whatever you click on won't open. 

The bug seems to be because of the unassigned 'Boost' notification. Because this specific notification is only visible in the 'all notifcation' tab, the other tabs (votes, subscribers, comments etc.) are not affected.
When the unassigned 'Boost' notification gets burried by other notifications, the site will not break unless you load it by scrolling down to it.

To explain the bug in simple terms:
When you boost a post, you can delete that post. The boost notification will point at a deleted post, find nothing and break the website through the notification system. 
Because of the way minds caches posts, a deleted post can and will still be processed. After deleting the post you made a timebomb that will break your notification system.

### Steps to reproduce:

1.  Create a media post on your profile (image)

2.  Boost the post on your profile (must be of type Newsfeed)

3.  Delete the post permanently on your profile

4.  Revoke the boosted post in the Boost Console (this will also happen if boost approved or rejected).

5. Check the notification window, it should behave incorrectly and show critical damage to the website

### Browser and OS

Mozilla Firefox 68.0 reported by: @aobachan

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Screenshot should be self explanatory.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

If a notification is somehow corrupted and causing an issue, the front end should simply be able to disregard it, though the underlying cause here needs to be investigated and amended.

### Summary

Blue NSFW selector does not neccesarily mean nsfw is selected, unless you click it to view the list before posting.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make an nsfw post.
2. Click wallet.
3. go back to the feed and make a new post - Do not touch the nsfw-selector, just note its still blue.
4. Observe post is not NSFW

### Platform information 

Cross-platform web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

NSFW selectors existing value is not respected
 
### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

If its blue, it should be flagging it NSFW for the reasons contained, without clicking on the selector (check afterward).

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

Pro users groups page only shows a handful of groups with only a hand full of members, he has many popular groups. Also it should be sorted by popularity.

@edgebal commented:
Seems we just found some rounding issue on group owner GUIDs, we might need to check ElasticSearch. I see 614198139255005200 as the owner, and FretzCapo is 614198139255005203. Looks like JS rounding.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Visit https://www.minds.com/pro/FretzCapo/groups
2. The groups listed in [his channel](https://www.minds.com/FretzCapo/) description are the ones he would like to appear on his pro page
2. Observe none of his popular groups (listed on his profile bio) are there, e.g. [UnfuckTheWorld](https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/624575371760640005/feed)

He says he is the original creator of the groups.

### Platform information 
Browser

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Small groups are the only ones showing up.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

* Should be sorted by popularity.
* Should find all groups.

Alternative

* Use Groups channel belongs to
* Channel can show or hide groups they belong to on their pro page

* Boosted bost content variations -> https://invis.io/KWU1X9IEB2U#/393843178_Boosted_Post_Variations

#### Design Notes

* Boosted post container has a fixed height of `720px`. It is important that the varied nature of posts is presented as a clear and consistent structure as possible.
* Boosted content distinguishes itself with a blue border and `Bosted Content` label at the top-left.
* The total number of boosted posts is displayed top-right.
* An animated countdown wheel shows when the next post will display. Duration TBC.
* If the cursor enters any portion of the boosted post container, the posts will not transition. The timer will be *paused* and elapsed timer *set to zero*.
* If the user starts typing a comment, the timer should be reset and paused.
* We may introduce some subtle animation between posts, in order to make the change from one post to another less severe. TBC.
* The first boosted post instance should not be the first item in a users news feed. First occurrence should be the second item.
* Other instances of the boosted content should be displayed as the user continues to scroll through the newsfeed. Perhaps every 10 newsfeed items. Frequency TBC.
* Given there will be multiple instances of the scrolling boosted posts, it is important that the user doesn’t see the same boosted content again and again.  The boosted content displayed should be as unique as possible to the user.
* Given the consistent height of the boosted post container, we need to account for all the various permutations of content that could be displayed. See above InVision link.
* Any comments are hidden by default.",3

### Summary

1. Links change on signup - possibly not the case in @eiennohi's hopepage redesigns (need to check).
2. iPhone href - This is probably going to take some upgraded regex (it thinks the /p in the iphone link is telling it its one of our pages).
3. https://www.minds.com and https://minds.com.

@medworthy 
> Before logging in, the side bar displays links in example 1. However, when refreshing or returning to the Newsfeed section, example 2 is displayed (note that I have tested this with Quantum and Blink based browsers).

> The iPhone href returns a blank page.

> Also within the minds.com/p pages (ie. dmca, terms, contact, bill of rights etc.), at the top of the left sidebar, there is a similar href (which again, displays the title “IPHONE”) that links to the same URL as above. 

> I have also noticed that within the minds.com/p pages, some hrefs refer to URL’s that are prefixed with “https://www.minds.com/”, whilst other hrefs lack the www prefix (ie. “https://minds.com/”). This inconsistency looks unprofessional and needs to be resolved

- Multiple logouts and new signups in the same browser session will mess up the onboarding flow for the new signup

### Steps to reproduce

Register a new channel, onboarding wizard will be in third step, hit previous. 

![2019-10-11-10-52-57](/uploads/c23a7b27a73bd236d211b7b969b2fb92/2019-10-11-10-52-57.mp4)

### Platform information 

Browser

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- Starts in third step of four (or the last step reached)
- Third step does not have close button x
- Next button on first step skips to third step

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- [ ] Onboarding wizard should start on step one
- [ ] Step One next button should not skip to step three
- [ ] Step three should have a close button like other steps
- [ ] Step three modal should be approx the same vertical size as other steps

### Suggestion to Fix

- [ ] On logout delete session, currently sessions accumulate.

### Summary

With reference to a recent H&S enquiry, I have tested an example blog article and found that whilst not purchasing access to locked articles, I am able to copy and paste the obscured text content of said locked article into external text editors and word processor applications. 

The example blog article also contains video content (provided via the YouTube bridge) in which the audio content can be listened to whilst the article is locked.

### Steps to reproduce

View a blog article whilst it is locked (ie. needing a predetermined amount of tokens to be able to access said content) and then attempt to listening to any video / audio content, as well as attempting to copy the text content to an external application.

### Platform information 
I believe that this is user platform neutral. However, I have tested this whilst using Firefox (x86_64 version 68.0.2) and Chromium (x86_64 version 76.0.3809).

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

See above

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Locked content should not be accessible to the user (until the user purchases access to said content).

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

## Goal

We need to establish the effort involved in implementing the SKALE side of the bridge, by prototyping integration, adding panels and see how nicely things play 


## What needs to be done

Possibly the creation of fully working parts of integration if everything goes smoothly.
If everything does not, then we need to have follow-up cards created addressing any issues and any components that are going to need creating manually.

## QA

Depends on deliverable - if working components are deliverable then they should be tested but this is more of an investigative card.

Report categories should be updated to reflect the chart in the following section. Below is a list of changes:

**Text-only changes**

1. Change 'pedophilia' to 'sexualization of minors'
2. Change 'Encourages or incites violence' to 'Incitement to violence'
3. Change 'Impersonates' to 'Impersonation'
4. Change 'Copyright' to 'Intellectual Property Violation'
5. Change 'Token manipulation' to 'Inauthentic engagement'
6. Change ""Sex trafficking"" to ""Trafficking""

**Removals**

Remove the following categories:

1. Trademark infringement (because it is merged with IP violation)
2. Incorrect use of hashtags (because it does nothing)

**Modifications**

Under 'Intellectual Property Violations' (formerly 'Copyright') we need to link to the Zendesk DMCA form instead of saying to email to copyright@minds.com.

### Summary

When Activity manager add and update functions throw out StringValidator and Email Verification errors, they're caught and logged at the newsfeed POST endpoint. 

E.g.  https://sentry.io/organizations/minds-inc/issues/2520826688/?project=1538020&query=is%3Aunresolved 

This eats into logs and they should just be errors returned back to the user for consumption.

Trigger a string length validation error, enter a large post above bounds and see output error is not a StringLengthValidation exception. Look in controller - it is being logged.

### Platform information

### Possible fixes

We're using two blue colors in the themes file, both `$m-blue` and `$m-link`

### Platform information 

Macbook, chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Different shades of blue exist on the site

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

We should only be using the latest blue, which is `$m-link`.  BUT it should be called `$m-blue`, because it is used for a variety of elements, not just links. 
### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

### Possible fixes

Change the `$m-blue` hex codes in the themes.scss file to those that are currently called `$m-link`",1

--->

### Summary

NSFW boost check comes in AFTER payment has been made for boost. This probably hasn't been flagged as an issue because boosting onchain is too expensive to be viable on mainnet.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make NSFW post.
2. Try to boost onchain.
3. Observe payment modal pops up.
4. After accepting, boost is rejected.

### Platform information 

Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Boost payment is taken for a boost that is invalid

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should check BEFORE the first call for the boost is made on the front-end, so no payment is taken.

104626391,2022-03-11 15:43:43.877,In-feed notices,"## Background

* We currently struggle to display notices / prompts in a consistent and clear manner.
  * Build you algorithm is one-off design
  * Verify email is a one-off design
  * Some notices such as 'Minds Chat' appear in the sidebar.
    * Anything displayed in the sidebar is available to desktop users only, so mobile responsive and mobile users miss out.
* Additionally, we want to present new calls to action to users, e.g. Download the app, Refer friends

## Proposition

The above issues have prompted us to explore a means a more effective method of delivering notices.
* Notices should be designed as a system, that can be used across all screen sizes on web, as well as mobile.
* There should be consistent design languages across all notices.
* We assume that clear, relevant and well positioned notices will result in an upward trend of actions committed by the user.

## Designs

* [Responsive component designs](https://www.figma.com/file/EkJej3mKP2lSzmWTLoqlXD/Minds-Design-System?node-id=865%3A7348)
* [Light mode example](https://www.figma.com/file/EkJej3mKP2lSzmWTLoqlXD/Minds-Design-System?node-id=865%3A9264)
* [Questionnaire](https://www.figma.com/proto/EkJej3mKP2lSzmWTLoqlXD/Minds-Design-System?page-id=865%3A7347&node-id=865%3A8394&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom)
* [Verify email](https://www.figma.com/proto/EkJej3mKP2lSzmWTLoqlXD/Minds-Design-System?page-id=865%3A7347&node-id=865%3A8388&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom)

## Behaviors
1. Notices appear on the Newsfeed. We should leave open the possibility to display them elsewhere in the future.
2. Only one notice is displayed per page. If the user qualifies for multiple notices, the highest-priority notice is displayed until either (a) its action is completed, or (b) the notice is dismissed.
3. The notice states should be consistent across sessions and devices. If a user dismisses the questionnaire notice on web, they should not then see it on mobile.
4. When user clicks dismiss, should it be dismissed for 60 days.
----
- **For the future**: We want to use this component to message many more things in the future (e.g. user surveys, connect wallet, town hall invites, etc.) but we're concerned about overwhelming the feeds. While not necessary for this initial effort, we should think about and plan for a method for determining when and where in a feed to present these to users, when they are most likely to engage with them. Consider every appearance of a notice an opportunity, and the opportunity cost of presenting the wrong one, presenting one at the wrong time, etc.

## Notices
There are many applications for in-feed notices, however the initial iteration will be limited to the following use cases.

| Notice                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      | Dismissable | Position | Sticky | Display priority | Conditions                              | Primary action                                                            | Secondary action                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Verify your email address | Click the link in your email to verify your address and get the most out of Minds. This helps us fight spammers. (Ironically, check your spam folder if you don't find our email in your inbox.) | No          | Top      | Yes    | 1                | User has not yet verified email         | Re-send email                                                             |                                           |
| Enable notifications      | Get alerted when someone replies to you, or likes, reminds, or subscribes to your content. Customize your settings to decide which notifications you want.                                       | Yes         | In-feed  | No     | 3                | User has not enabled push notifications | Enable notifications                                                      | Customize (link to notifications settings) |
| Build your algorithm      | Take control of your social media. Your preferences will improve your Discovery and similar feeds. But don't worry, it won't impact your default newsfeed.                                       | Yes         | Top      | No     | 2                | User has not yet completed BYA          | Complete questionnaire (launch modal)                                     | Learn more (link to blog)                 |
| Invite friends            | Minds gets better with friends. Share your referral link to invite them to join. If they earn money on Minds, you'll earn a 5% referral fee.                                                     | Yes         | In-feed  | No     | 4                | User has no referrals in last 60 days   | Share invite (copy referral URL; on mobile, display native share options) |                                           |

## Analytics

For each new type of in-feed notice we create, we should set up analytics that let us measure the reach and effectiveness of the notice. Things to measure:

- [ ] Impressions: How many times was a notice viewed
- [ ] Engagements (Primary): How many times did the primary action get clicked
- [ ] Engagements (Secondary): How many times did the secondary action get clicked
- [ ] Dismissals: How many times was the notice dismissed (user clicked `X` to remove)

## Acceptance
- [ ] A new user who has not yet verified an email address will see the `Verify your email address` notice.
- [ ] A user who has not yet enabled push notifications will see the `Enable push notifications` notice.

104283067,2022-03-07 11:44:01.967,Limit modals to display images or videos only.,"### Background

Currently modals display any kind of post entity, be it a video, image, pure text, embedded URL etc. Clicking anywhere on any activity in a feed will launch a modal.

The value for the user is afforded when using a modal is the increased screen real estate. This suits images and videos, but not necessarily text.

The reason we currently allow text posts to be displayed in a modal is because of the grid view, as text posts in the grid are so limited, a modal is required to view them in their entirety.


### Proposal

* When viewing content in a feed, only clicking on an image, or expanding a video will launch a modal.
* When viewing content within a grid, clicking on a post, no matter its type, will launch a modal.

### Benefits

* More predictable user experience for the user. I can not see any comparable social network that display text content in a modal in this fashion.
* The unpredictability as mentioned above is a context shift for the user, as they are unknowingly going from a feed to a modal. This could be hurting retention.

Happy to hear thoughts on this one.

This requires using [virtualized lists](https://web.dev/virtualize-lists-with-angular-cdk/) to boost the performance of feeds. using these lists, we won't be rendering all components of the list, but only those that are near the viewpoint. This is crucial for features such as #5327 

a demonstration of virtualized lists on twitter:

![virtualized-list](/uploads/79a28f42096ad157b971d73c96b217b3/virtualized-list.mov)

This also requires us to keep the state of the feed in memory or in localStorage (if we want to cache it). It's best to start with in-memory and at a later date think about caching it

\* if possible, look into how we can simplify the pagination and other logic of all feeds with a new Feed component (like mobile's FeedList)

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->

we want to add caching functionality to the web app. this allows us to do so many things, such as improving UX, supporting optimistic loading, and [keeping feed scroll position](https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5210), etc.

we should figure out the best way to achieve this:

- For the network resources necessary to load the app and file-based content we should consider [service workers](https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5033) which requires [pwa](https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/epics/156)
- For other data, we should consider [IndexedDb](https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5027) and localStorage as a fallback

essential read: 
https://web.dev/storage-for-the-web/

## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->

Create a stateful layer on top of ApiService that holds state and data about its endpoint and has utility functions such as loadMore, refresh, and fetch. This state can then be persisted and rehydrated which allows us to have endpoint-specific local caching. This cache can be stored in localStorage, IndexedDb, SessionStorage, or in memory depending on the use case.

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->

TBD

## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.
--->

No design or UX change apart from having caches from some endpoints which makes them load instantly and update according to their cache policy.

## Personas

<!---
Who does this user impact and why (optional)
--->

All users.

## Experiments

<!---
Experiments are not required, but they should be made clear if one is expected. If experiments are required, the hypothesis should be outlined.
--->

No experiments are needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Everyone should be able to understand what is expected to be delivered

  - [ ] memory storage

### Summary

Posts that include both media and text content are laid-out incorrectly when being displayed within the modal dialog box.

<b>1.</b> Media content (seems to be only affecting embedded using a third party service, such as YouTube or directly attached to the post) is being displayed on the left side of the post and directly next to the modal dialog box's left side boarder<br><br>
<b>2.</b> Lengthy body text is unable to be scrolled.<br><br>
<b>3.</b> Modal dialog box may not display the top and / or bottom portions of post's body text depending on length of said body text.<br><br>
<b>4.</b> Media files can be of an inconstant size depending on length of included body text.

### Steps to reproduce

View a post that contains both embedded media content and a fairly large amount of text within the modal dialog box.

### Platform information 

End-user platform neutral. Browser based (tested using Webkit, Quantum / Gecko and Blink rendering engine based browsers). 

Suggest having a look through my own (medworthy) channel and reviewing how some of my more lengthy posts are displayed within the modal dialog box.

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

No warning is shown that a password fails risk test outside of the modal that appears when your cursor is in the password input.

This might initially seem like a non-issue because we do warn when entering the password, but a user is on auto-pilot quickly filling out a password (or perhaps with some password managers), they'll be left unable to click the submit button, not knowing why unless they think to click back into the password field. 

This could also potentially happen if there was a delay in the password check request.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to register via modal.
2. Use a password that is valid but fails the risk assessment, like `Pa$$w0rd`.
3. Ignore the modal warning and continue to try to register.
4. No warning is shown and you cannot click the submit button.
5. Click back on password field, you see the risk assessment failed.

Same issue happens on the /register page but I'm pretty sure that is because its the same component.

### Platform information 

Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

A user speeding through the registration form can enter a failing password and not realise, leaving them unable to create an account.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

There should be an indicator or warning somewhere outside of the modal.

Images fail to load

### Steps to reproduce

Scrolling the newsfeed, a group, or a channel, or viewing an individual post.

### Platform information 

Firefox 96 on Ubuntu 21 using Canary

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

This started a few days ago.
A blurry placeholder image appears but the actual image never does.
Images sometimes load but fail other times, non-deterministically.
I thought it was related to when the post was published but on occasion it defies this rule.
I thought it was related to loading on infinite scroll but on occasion it defies this rule.
Sometimes, the first image on infinite scroll loads properly but none after that.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

An image.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

### Summary

Transactions of type `offchain:Pro Payout` have no corresponding text entry in our ledger - so it shows only as the default ""Transaction"".

### Steps to reproduce

You could reproduce by sending an offchain pro payout, but the simplest way would be to 

Edit one of the transactions in the db such that when the call is made to https://www.minds.com/api/v2/blockchain/transactions/ledger

It returns an object containing a `contract` variable with the value of `offchain:Pro Payout`

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

In order to advance open discourse, and to support video creators on Minds who don't use YouTube, we should enable rich-embed features for videos shared from Odysee and Rumble, on Minds.

Also reported previously by @MindsGaming here https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/4109

### Current behavior

If a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post, we pull in the the thumbnail and headline of the linked video.

If a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via a blog post, we simply display the URL.

### Desired behavior

If a user shares an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post OR a blog post, we display a playable rich embed that allows the user to watch the video on Minds.

### Debug notes

Data is there in iFramely but is not displayed on our site.

### Possible fixes

Possibly being filtered by anti-XSS measures?

## Acceptance
- [ ] When sharing an Odysee or Rumble URL via an activity post, the video is playable from the activity post without having to click off of Minds to another site.
- [ ] When sharing an Odysee or Rumble URL in a blog post, the URL is replaced with a playable, rich embed that allows a reader to watch the video without having to click off of Minds to another site.",2

75916590,2020-12-10 17:50:38.025,Link refunds in boost console to the transaction of the refund,"### The problem
Issues with boost refunds are difficult for admins and users alike to track. Some users erroneously believe they were not refunded, other users have had actual refunds that were not credited. When there are multiple boosts, this becomes very difficult to gain proof of the claim before we can refund.

### Proposal
If a boost is in a refunded state, we should either store or be able to generate an indicator of when the refund was paid.

Ideally, clicking the text would link to your ledger and auto-scroll to the correct place, but at minimum, the date and time of a refund should be shown with the text.

I tried to replicate but I got different erronous behavior; no matter what it is set to it still shows on my feeds.

### Steps to reproduce

1. set a new blog to logged in and publish
2. check your feed
3. log out check your channel

- Grid view will `not` be available on `small` screens
- Activity items are displayed in an alternate, simplified means. Author info and social interactions are not present. In a future iteration we aim to re-introduce social interactions to some degree.
- For the first iteration, clicking on an item will simply bring the user to the dedicated post page. In a future release, the posts will be displayed within a modal.
- 'Reminds' will be excluded from the grid layout.
- Ideally the date should be updated, so only the relative times are displayed when a datetime fell within the last 48 hrs i.e. `just now`, `a few hour ago`, `yesterday` and so on - otherwise display the Month/day. e.g. `Sept 15th`",3

### Summary

Big thanks to Chesschats for pointing this one out to us.
https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1137736597458186240

When you remind from a newsfeed page, it doesn't create a remind - it creates a copy of the original entity, down to the GUID.
This causes strange behaviours around the area of commenting and notifications - if you delete it also breaks things. If you delete the secondary post, it leaves the original post but removes the actual media.

If you do it with text in the remind box, it actually saves as the description of the new post. It is getting posted to the api/v2/newsfeed/remind/x endpoint.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make a post with an image
2. Click timestamp to go to newsfeed page
3. Remind
4. Check your channel, see the post is cloned, not a remind.
5. Mouse over the timestamps to see the guids in the URLs are identical.

### Platform information 

Initially reported on iOS Safari tablet 
Replicated Firefox Ubuntu

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Post is cloned, not reminded

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Reminding should work like everywhere else on the site.

* The SuperMind (console) is accessible via the `More Menu` within the main navigation.
* Users will also be directed here from email and push notifications.
* This SuperMind console is separate from the Boost console.
  * This console displays only the incoming requests [Requests received](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=319%3A12073)
  * And outgoing requests [Requests sent](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=338%3A12739)
* The settings icon contained within the above designs will link directly to the SuperMind settings (within the Settings Area).

**Requests Received**

* A user may either reply to a request, or choose to reject it.
* A producer has \[72 hours\] to respond to a request.
* Any expired request will disappear from `Requests Received`
* Requests are ordered from new -> old.
* Each request will also display any meta data relevant to the request.
  * Offer amount
  * Twitter post
  * Content type: Text, Video, Image, Remind.
* If the user clicks reject, funds are refunded to the consumer and a notification sent (As detailed within notification)
* Where the user clicks reply, the composer is launched.
  * Note: If the is the users first-time replying to a SuperMind request, they will need to read and agree to the relevant terms of user.
  * After doing so, they’ll then be directed to the composer.
  * If there’s there are specific content requirements, this could be communicated within the placeholder copy. (e.g. video required).

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

This is a regression caused by https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/merge_requests/2002. After opening the dropdown, clicking anywhere (the overlay) will navigate to the post.

### Steps to reproduce

- The following actions cause navigation instead of their default behavior
  - dismissing the activity dropdown
  - dismissing the Quote dropdown
  - subscribing/unsubscribing from the channel publisher card
  - clicking See more

- also notice that the activity will keep being highlighted even after moving the cursor outside of the post

Potentially a different issue, but still related to !2002 

- The radius around buttons is small for upvotes, downvotes, comments, reminds, tips and boosts etc, so if you miss by 1-2 pixels, you open modal. We need to introduce a larger clickable area for most buttons on the activity
- Clicking play on native videos was previously opening modal, now it goes to post page
- Unlocking NSFW posts

### Platform information 

browser

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- clicking on the overlay causes navigation
- activity is highlighted even though cursor is outside

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- clicking on the overlay should dismiss the dropdown
- activity should not be highlighted if the cursor is outside of it

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

* Users can create SuperMind requests via a number of entry points.
  * Via an activity post (in-feed or post entity)
  * Via a channel (by clicking `SuperMind` within the header)
  * Via the composer (when creating a post and toggling SuperMind)

**Create Request Flow from Composer**

* Regardless which entry point a user tags, the proceeding flow is the same. The workflow when creating a SuperMind request is outline within the following prototype and detailed below. **[A. Create Supermind from post entity - Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=295%3A9679&viewport=857%2C575%2C0.13&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=295%3A9679&show-proto-sidebar=1)**
  * The compose will launch. The SuperMind badge will appear top-right. Note also the slight change in context of the composer toolbar.
    * Monetise has been removed
    * The post button has been replace with a continue button.
    * \[Confirm which options to be omitted from the ellipsis menu\]
  * When a user presses continued, they will be brought to the SuperMind screen. Here the user can confirm the targeted channel, define an offer amount and currency type.
    * A user can pay in either tokens or cash.
    * A user can only pay in cash where the producer has a bank account connected to their minds account.
    * Where the producer does not have a connected bank account, the consumer will not see a cash option
  * When a SuperMind request is made, there are a total of four response types. There are:
    * Any reply (Text)
    * Video Reply
    * Image Reply
    * Remind
  * It is assumed that Twitter integration will not be required for the first iteration.
  * Where a minimum offer value is present, a user can not submit a request where the minimum offer has not be satisfied.
  * Once the user presses ‘Send Request’ a notice will display informing them that the request has been sent and when to expect a reply.
  * [Responsive mobile composer - prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=825%3A17105&viewport=-9081%2C5560%2C1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=825%3A17105&show-proto-sidebar=1)
  * [Responsive mobile composer](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=866%3A17125)

**Create Request from Activity Post in Feed**

* A new `S` SuperMind icon is to appear within the activity post interactions, replacing tip. Tip is to be moved within the ellipsis menu - **[B. Activity Post in-feed prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=287%3A5128&viewport=-9081%2C5560%2C1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=287%3A5128&show-proto-sidebar=1)**
* After clicking on the SuperMind prompt, the the composer will launch with the quoted post in-view.
* Additionally, we may want to draw attention to the `SuperMind` button within the activity post (feed).
  * Where a user interests with a post (i.e. up-vote) we could highlight the SuperMind button my means of a popover.

**Create request from activity post entity**

* Two larger more prominent prompts will appear within this view, `Boost` and `SuperMind` - [Post Entity Design - Owner](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=295%3A9679)
* The boost option will only displaying when viewing one’s own content. When viewing someone else’s post, the `SuperMind` CTA will span full-width.[Post Entity - Visitor](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=295%3A10153)

**Via the Composer**

* Additionally users may create SuperMind requests from within the composer, without being referred from a post or from within the channel.
* Note the inclusion of the new `S` / SuperMind icon with the composer toolbar.
  * As the user types, if they enter a valid channel name, attention should be brought to the `S` icon with a tooltip.
  * Clicking the `S` will lunch the SuperMind screen, where they can define the target, currency type, bid etc.
  * Alternatively the user can simply open the SuperMind menu without necessarily specifying a channel name within the composer itself.
* See prototype here -> **[C. Supermind directly from composer](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=295%3A9679&viewport=857%2C575%2C0.13&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=295%3A9679&show-proto-sidebar=1)**

#5697 revealed a weakness in how the activity content component handles `showPaywall` and `showPaywallBadge`. They are currently passed as inputs to the content component, but they should be grabbed from the activity service, _inside_ the content component.

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->
Create a feed that contains all the different permutations of posts (rich-embed, status, image, video, quote, remind, paywalled+locked, paywalled+unlocked, nsfw, long text, short text, has title, etc. - [see spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JrOPTSziDAubeziV8pR-nnxJI_6ko6SGxk2s9rEtiag/edit#gid=0)). This way anyone who is working on changes to activities can scan through it and get a good idea of what they're working with and what has changed, instead of having to search around the site and find examples. 

Consider making a pair or trio of channels so we can see the posts from all permutations of access (e.g. channel A has a bunch of different posts. log in to channel B to see those posts when paywalls are locked, log in to channel C to see those posts when paywalls are unlocked. 

The channel's ""about"" info should contain guidelines on adding content to the feed and using the channel for testing.

## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->
- Make a list of the types of activity posts we want to see

## Goal

- Allow users to send a Supermind request to a channel from that person's channel page

## What needs to be done

Add a Supermind call to action to all channel pages.

* A `Supermind` call-to-action will appear top-right. It will remain visible whether a user is subscribed [Subscribed visitor state](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=292%3A7563)or [Unsubscribed visitor state](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=292%3A7870) to the channel being viewed.
* The `Supermind` CTA will not be visible when displaying one’s own channel.

When a user clicks the Supermind CTA, the composer is launched and automatically opens to the Supermind payment panel. The fields are pre-filled with the originating channel name as the target, and that channel's minimums.

### Summary

Twitter support for Metascraper is patchy - we should see if there is anything we can do to improve previews.
Take for example https://twitter.com/fotoperfeito/status/1545163618517454849?s=20&t=R_cMKzsVMu-PrUbQxKV4jw

See https://github.com/microlinkhq/metascraper/issues/260#issuecomment-1171194503 for additional information

One weird thing is that if you include the audio or video query params, an image is found https://api.microlink.io?url=https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1483427748500717573&audio=true

Another thing to look at it why some points repeat description and title, with no author.

112004038,2022-06-30 21:25:38.421,Activities v2: Boost rotator improvements,"## Goal

Address the following UX concerns with respect the Boost Rotator in the context of the new activity post designs.

1. The social interactions at the bottom of the rotator get pushed outside the confines of the boost rotator when posts are lengthy.
2. The presentation of the post content within the boost rotator is oftentimes poorly presented.
3. The navigation controls (more left/right) are perceived to be lost/unclear


## What needs to be done

- [ ] Address the above three issues as indicated in the UX/Design heading 

### Other bugs that should be research / resolved as part of this issue MAKE NEW TASKS PLEASE

- [ ] The rotator shows horizontal scroll bars for quote posts
- [ ] Videos don't autoplay within the boost rotator
- [ ] When just a youtube link is contained within the post, the video embed does not appear. Just the link is displayed.

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed

## UX/Design

1. [New Boost Rotator Header](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=707%3A3838)
  * Larger clearer boost rotator header with its own BG colour.
  * Larger nav controls moved to the RHS
2. [Social Interactions](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=818%3A3769)
  * Social interaction should remain in a fixed position at the bottom on the boost rotator.
  * The length height of the boosted post should not impact upon the position of the social interactions.
  * Where content overruns a slight gradient fadeout appears as indicated in the above design link.
  * Clicking `See More` will navigate the user to the post page
3. [Revised content positioning](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=808%3A3662)
  * Content should be positioned in the middle of the available area between the post header and social interactions.
  * Where there is text with an embed (URL, Image, Video) the [associated text should sit alongside the embed](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=808%3A3725).
  * See below numerous design examples which should clarify this.
    * [Text and image not overflowing](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=707%3A3838)

## Goal

Cleaning up a few issues with the v2 Boost rotator to unblock the production experiment of Activities v2.

## What needs to be done

Issues with Boosts blocking the launch of the experiment:

- Visual of the ""Boosted Post"" label + arrow button controls at the top of the rotator
- The rotator doesn't deal well with boosted posts that are very tall. Some screenshots below as examples.
- The rotator shows horizontal scroll bars for quote posts
- Videos don't autoplay

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

## Goal

We should add a utility to the admin panel that allows admins to easily set staging cookies - it's happened a few times where the cookie is incorrectly set because of things like path or exp time.

The benefit of this is that admins testing with the staging cookie is our final safety net before things go out into production - if admins are misconfigured, issues can hit prod and can and have caused superhero events that were entirely avoidable.

## What needs to be done

- Create a new page such as `devtools`
- Simple radio buttons with the environment on you wish to select

## QA

Test staging cookie was set or removed based on selected radio

## UX/Design

Probably not needed too in depth but a general ""we should put this here"" would be good.

### Summary

When viewing an activity post with an embedded third party video (e.g. YouTube, Rumble, Odysee), the user needs to click a play button twice before the video will begin playing.

- Load the mobile web Minds app on a phone
- View an activity post with an embedded YouTube video
- Click the play button

### Platform information 

- Android + Brave (?)
- iPhone + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- The video thumbnail + play button is replaced with a video embed
- The video embed does NOT begin playing automatically

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- The video embed DOES begin playing automatically

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

[Video recording in this comment](https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5585#note_1011070489).

### Possible fixes

YouTube embed code allows for specifying an autoplay state.

Possibly other video services do as well.

Note that even if using the autoplay parameter, it's possible the YouTube video will not autoplay because of browser autoplay media permissions. [More info here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide).",1

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->

To eliminate needless guesswork, component names should clearly indicate what the component does and how it is used. 

This is _mostly_ for changing the names of things that are the most misleading or don't reflect component hierarchy (as opposed to formatting everything so it fits with BEM rules). 

The list of names to change is: 
 
- [x] m-shadowboxLayout > data tab
- [x] m-concertColors__modal > (name shouldn't depend on an image it formerly used ) photo banner modal?
- [x] m-formToast > (also used outside of forms) m-toast...should probably also do the related service
- [x] m-reports__marketing > (this is actually the content policy aux page) content policy?
- [x] m-wireCreator__marketingBlock > (not clear what is being marketed) m-wireCreator__upgradeBlock
- [x] m-composer__preview > m-composer__previewWrapper
- [x] m-composerRichEmbedPreview > m-composerPreview--richEmbed
- [x] m-composerRemindPreview > m-composerPreview--quote (it's a QUOTE not a remind)
- [x] m-composerAttachmentPreview > m-composerPreview--attachment
- [x] minds-groups-join-button (more than just join) > m-group__membershipButton
- [x] m-homepagecontainer > m-homepageContainer
- [x] minds-form-login > looks too ancient... change to m-loginForm
- [x] minds-form-register > m-registerForm


## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->
- [x] Change names of list above
- [x] Where appropriate, also update css classes to match the component names
- [x] If changing names of `.scss` files, go ahead and convert to `.ng.scss` as needed

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Error messages are not being displayed when clicking on Help in menu. Zendesk passes messages back in the query string which are [supposed to be parsed here]( https://gitlab.com/minds/front/blob/dcb1406a62f26de588187146f856ca5be8913db0/src/app/modules/newsfeed/feeds/subscribed.component.ts#L168) and displayed in a toaster. 

### Steps to reproduce

Try to visit help with a second account with the same email as an account already registered with Zendesk - an error toast SHOULD appear

Haven't confirmed but this may be an example URL that should trigger the message:

https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/subscribed?kind=error&message=Please+use+one+of+the+options+below+to+sign+in+to+Zendesk.
 
### Platform information 

Web

- John: Windows, Chrome
- Ben: Ubuntu, Firefox

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Error message doesn't show - confusing.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Error message should show.

Continue component audit started in #5541 . 

## What needs to be done

Approx. 1/3 of components still need to be evaluated. This second batch should move faster than #5541 because the component list has already been compiled (here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CfSLcpmEKjzf-CDqu_aGM3DH1xcRU2_hGjSyC6cPe7Y/edit#gid=647707769) and the common components (which take longer to evaluate) are completed.  

As I go through them, make sure each of the components (the final 1/3) has at least one class-level comment to document its purpose/usage.

e.g. the <m-accordion> component ""creates a re-usable vertical accordion layout. To be used in conjunction with <m-accordion__pane> component. Used in channel editor.""

### Summary

When entering your phone number, a toast error saying ""You must verify your account"" is passed back from the engine. This could cause confusion for a user who is trying to verify their phone number.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make a new account
2. Try to input phone number before verifying email address

### Platform information 

Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Error message is confusing.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- Throw this toast before the modal appears
- Should read something more like `You must confirm your email address` (for both before, and when sent from the engine - requires change to UnverifiedEmailException.
- The error at the bottom saying invalid phone number should not show unless the phone number is invalid.

### Summary

If a user makes a post in Canary, it does not seem possible to mark it as NSFW. The NSFW button doesn't work on posting.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Enter Canary mode (with UX-2020 / composer enabled).
2. Open post composer.
3. Select all NSFW reasons.
4. Upload a cat picture.
![image](/uploads/fb20803461833857397988da2f191c5b/image.png)
5. Post - observe no NSFW mask

### Platform information 

Cross-platform web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

No NSFW mask shown on image - media entity the text seems to see it?

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should show the mask if the user's mature (or is_mature, double check which is which), it should show something indicating a mask is there for other users if they have it set to true.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,

### Steps to reproduce

Will require some investigation but presumably:
1. Hit offchain limit
2. Try to boost onchain

It could be something to do with previous selections and state getting mixed up also.

https://docs.sendwyre.com/v3/docs/hosted-widget-1

SendWyre changed their api on us, but actually made our life easier.

The first step is to get this working with the new payout flow.

We need to cut out our checkout site entirely from the equation and display the official payment site in a separate. 

We won't be worrying about the callback url to send the actual transaction data, just yet. But we probably need to specify the return URL and error url. 


@markeharding and @ottman opening a new tab and keeping our site open might create this situation.  Tab A is minds with the wire dialog. Tab B is the new sendwyre pay functionality. I bet you two dollars that the SendWyre buttons will redirect Tab B back to whatever URL we specify, so that will mean Tab A and Tab B will remain open with our site.

It might be a smoother experience to open in the original Tab A, but that runs the risk of them closing it. @benhayward.ben is going to test the interaction to verify.",8

@markeharding @ottman what about tiers that exceed the single entity paywall amount? Should supporters get access to that if their tier contribution covers the individual cost? Or do we want to keep single amounts separate.

### Possible fixes

As highlighted by @markharding perhaps we should migrate the check for whether a user has made post to an ES count query as it's possible the ACL is stripping things out the way we are currently getting it. This is just an idea though, the issue could be something else. It could be for example, scheduled posts showing in that query.",2

122999653,2023-02-03 12:00:08.182,Migrate homepage(s) to use Angular Image Directive to improve SEO and general performance,"<!---
Please read this!

The Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Improve image load experience, especially LCP time on homepage initially which could potentially have large benefits for SEO - if this is a success, continue to migrate images around the site.

https://www.landsend.com/ migrated in a lab experiment as saw a 75% increase in LCP - we should definitely experiment to see if we get similar results.

## What needs to be done

Implement new [Angular Image directive](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive) on the homepage - **need to discuss whether this is scoped to both variants of the homepage or just the old one for testing purposes**. This directive is new out of developer preview with Angular 15.

Features of note include:

- Intelligent lazy loading based on for example, page visibility
- fetchPriority control 
- Experimental “fill” mode so that it pre-occupies space
- Image loader strategies so that correctly sized images are loaded automatically based on the viewport.

We need to consider what to do with Blurhash and check whether it is compatible, or even needed anymore.

## QA

Test homepage(s?)

## UX/Design

There should be no design changes

## Mobile

- [ ] Is Mobile Required?

## Personas

Initially targeting an improved experience for crawlers while we learn to use the new directive optimally.

## Experiments

N/A - note though the guest mode experiment controls which homepage that you see for testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Learn about the directive via [the docs](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive) - figure out best practices and relay information to the team - possibly add to documentation for bonus points.
- [x] Explore whether we are in a position without engine changes where we can implement an [image loader strategy](https://angular.io/guide/image-directive#built-in-loaders) which will request images of the correct sizes for the viewport automatically - if this is too big of a task, break it out into another one.
- [x] Switch the homepages images to use the new image directive, following best practices, and sensible priorities.
- [x] Determine the best strategy for the homepage for preload hints for SSR and implement.
- [x] Determine what to do with Blurhash.
- [x] If it is possible (perhaps through a loader?) have it so that we only have to specify paths to the image in our CDN (are all images through our  CDN?) e.g. `ngSrc=""/assets/image.jpg""` rather than currently `[ngSrc]=""${this.cdnAssetsUrl}/assets/image.jpg""`.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

## Goal

Increase efficiency for the Admin team inside of the new Boost queue.

## What needs to be done

- Given a Boost appears in the Admin queue,
- when an Admin either approves or rejects the Boost,
- then the Boost is visually removed from the Admin queue

Note that the goal here is Admin efficiency. The faster we can get adjudicated Boosts out of the queue, the faster they can get through it.

With this in mind, worth considering prioritizing removing an item visually quickly, without waiting for network / validation. On the rare occasion that network / validations occurs, it may be preferable to quickly dismiss that item and have it re-appear in the queue (flash), rather than keep the item in the queue for the duration of the network / validation request.

Clicking a ""trend"" post in discovery feeds should open the item's SEP instead of what seems to be an arbitrary interim trend-specific page. (i.e. it should redirect to `/newsfeed/{guid}` instead of `/discovery/plus/trend/{guid}?f=top`)

Previously this component's existence was justified because of its back button, but now that we have implemented a back button on SEPs, this additional component is not necessary.

This will: 
- Match user expectations for what should happen when an activity is clicked in a feed
- Remove redundant trend-specific activity presentation page so we only have to maintain single entity views in one place

## Goal

Allow for onchain boosts to be submitted for the new dynamic boost pricing system

## What needs to be done

Allow selection of the onchain payment method for onchain boosts - tie to backend in https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2475

## QA

## UX/Design

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add onchain option for front-end in the modal v2 payment method selector - you can uncomment the HTML in the template and handle the integration on submission in the v2 boost service.
- [ ] We need to confirm the balance we want is the linked wallet balance, not necessarily the Metamask connected wallet's balance (this IS how we do it elsewhere).
- [ ] We need to tie submission flow to the new backend functionality integrated in https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/issues/2475

119616726,2022-11-30 10:27:59.256,Update slider behaviour for cash boost modal,"<!---
Please read this!

The Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Slider behavior is currently a bit trickier to use and adjust, we need to improve the feel and allow selection of differing amounts

## What needs to be done

----
@markryansallee to confirm behavior and remove this block. Questions:

1. What if a user wants to select a value outside of the ranges, such as $11 - is that not going to be possible? **DO NOT ALLOW $11 if it is not a segment provided from the backend.**.
2. Do we want the sliders to snap to the different values? **Yes, they should snap to values from the backend**.
---

Modify the slider such that the behavior matches the below:

![image](/uploads/e8f7c24d757018eb87549f030a2ccef6/image.png)

## QA

Test sliders

## UX/Design

See https://gitlab.com/minds/design/-/issues/69

## Personas

Boosting users

## Experiments

No direct experiment but is indirectly under the cash boost flag already.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Assess whether the native HTML input meets the criteria or if we should use something like https://angular-slider.github.io/ngx-slider/docs/classes/\_options\_.options.html
- [ ] Match amount sliders for cash and tokens to the behavior specified under the `What needs to be done` header above.
- [ ] Make sure we have ""thumbs"" above the slider than show the value on drag.
- [ ] Update E2E & Unit tests.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

## Goal

Clearly indicate that a user is about to boost for cash to alleviate confusion and accidental spending in the cash tab of the new boost modal designs.

## What needs to be done

Add a confirmation modal like this upon submitting a cash boost.

![image](/uploads/1ec1f8250535f5f989809ed62963de29/image.png)

## QA

Text that confirmation modal appears when making a cash boost.

## UX/Design

Agreeing to use existing components, and that this does not need a design spec.

## Personas

Boosting users.

## Experiments

Indirectly covered by the cash boost experiment, but no individual flag is needed for this.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add confirmation modal that only appears when submitting a cash boost (NOT TOKEN)
- [ ] Confirm the text to be within the modal - minor adjustments will be needed
- [ ] Check E2E tests don't need quickly updating - if they do it might be better to create a new Fragment for the confirmation modal, that can be used within the BoostMOdal fragment on hitting post for cash.  
- [ ] Fix any broken unit tests

## What needs to be done

Spec improvements to the UX of flows related to posting Superminds to Twitter to address the user stories above.

- Flow 1: Connecting to Twitter oauth before responding to a Supermind offer that requires Twitter repost. (Happens once for a user.)
- Flow 2: Reposting a Supermind respond to Twitter. (Can happen multiple times for a user.)

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Unify our data tag naming standards between E2E and our data pipelines.

## What needs to be done

Migrate our existing data-cy tags over to data-ref syntax and ensure that we have set rules in place for naming conventions. Some tags WILL need renaming as we must ensure they are relevant for data.

## QA

Tests should green light.

## UX/Design

N/A

## Personas

Developers and Data

## Experiments

N/A

## Acceptance Criteria

- Decide on the syntactic structure of a data-tag name and define it in our E2E docs - maybe reference it in a data docs page
  - Simple example could be `data-ref=block-element`, so for example implemented we could see `data-ref=composer-modal-submit-button`. Anything we can do to improve naming consistancy would be very much appreciated on the data side, so if they could regex out all `submit-button`'s, that'd be ideal. This is not neccesarily something easy to do cleanly but a clear definition helps
  - Bounce the proposal off @michael4tasman and @markryansallee before chiseling the rule into stone.
- Get rid of `data-minds` section of tag name - it's useless
- Update existing Codecept / Playwright E2E tests
- Update existing tags that are not already in use to abide by the convention.

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->
The experiment hasVariation() function has 2 inputs. One is the experiment name and the other is an optional value. Currently the optional value is by default set to a string `'on'` but a Growthbook update has changed the way it works and we should now set it to a boolean `true` by default instead.

## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->
- change the default value from `'on'` to `true`
- Wherever we are already using `experimentsService.hasVariation()`, if it doesn't already have a 'variation' input, add one: `'on'`

117902844,2022-10-17 15:30:45.047,Experiment: Prompt to Supermind when writing a comment,"## Goal

As a user making comments, I want my comments to get attention and engagement from their target.

Goal: Increase Supermind offers.

## What needs to be done

Hypothesis: Users who comment on activity posts of other creators are likely customers of Supermind. We can use the commenting flow to introduce the benefits of Supermind and increase Supermind offers.

Build a prompt that displays when a user is writing a comment that asks them to turn their comment into a Supermind. The prompt can only appear for top-level comments.

- Time the prompt after (a) the user has begun typing a comment, and (b) 5 seconds have passed.
- The prompt appears once for a user during a logged in session.
- Once the prompt has appeared, it will not appear again.

Clicking the prompt launches the Supermind offer screen, and pre-populates the composer afterward with the text that was input into the comment before they pressed the `Upgrade` button.

When the Supermind is posted, the comment input box is reset to blank.

If the Supermind is NOT posted and the Supermind offer / composer is closed, the comment input box is NOT reset to blank.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->

To reduce friction with our current card component (and so that we can drop support for checkout.minds.com), we want to implement Stripe Checkout. 

## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->

See https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create?lang=php for how to generate the session. We are only interested in the 'setup' phase at this moment. 

The complicated part is going to be the redirect logic. Stripe Connect can **not** be placed into an iFrame. 

### Proposed Flow (via /settings/payments/payment-methods)

1) User clicks 'Add new card'
2) Redirect to /api/v3/stripe/checkout/setup
3) `success_url` and `cancel_url` should be `/settings/payments/payment-methods`

### Proposed Flow (via Payment Methods (modals)

1) User select 'Add new card' from the dropdown selector
2) New card modal still loads and open `/api/v3/stripe/checkout/setup` in a new tab
3) card modal continues to poll for callback logic (use either cookies or cache)
4) `success_url` and `cancel_url` should be `/api/v3/stripe/checkout/inline-complete`
5) card modal will update after the callback

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed

Currently playing around with ideas for mobile and spoke with Jack and Ryan on the topic already, but my suggestion would be to test it out on web first and then move to mobile if received well. I will be following up with the mobile devs to get their opinion on the matter, but it brings up the topic of giving more attention to aligning mobile and web design practices and screens.

115195521,2022-09-16 09:56:52.296,Existing Group Administrators Unable To Delete Group Based Posts,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Existing (that were assigned prior to the recent feed changes) and newly assigned group administrators, as well as newly assigned moderators and possibly existing group moderators are unable to delete posts that other users have published to the corresponding groups due to omission of the ""delete"" option within the post drop-down menu

I have tested existing and newly assigned administrator access, and existing moderators access but I am unable to verify the existing moderators access. 

### Steps to reproduce

As a group administrator or moderator, try to delete another users posts from your group.

### Platform information 

Platform neutral (browser interface).

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

No option is available to delete another users posts in a group that you are an administrator or moderator of.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should be able to delete another users posts in a group that you are an administrator or moderator of.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

### Possible fixes

115165120,2022-09-15 19:46:49.215,Signature verification failure on wallet connection,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Signatures are being rejected by the engine on production when connecting a wallet. Testing the params passed to engine locally against MW3, this SHOULD work fine.

```sh
node index.js verifyMessage --message=""{\""user_guid\"":\""1033785333306630163\"",\""unix_ts\"":1663270583}"" --signature=""~my signed message~""
```

Two possibilities 

1. Something is messed up with our signer in prod - maybe it's not up to date with what my local stack has or has uncommited changes
2. The message is being escaped server side and passed in wrong - I did this accidentally when copying and it will result in incorrect output

### Steps to reproduce

Try to connect a wallet for rewards - DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT / AN ACCOUNT YOU ARE COLLECTING REWARDS ON

### Platform information 

Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Cannot connect wallet

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should be able to connect wallet

Long comments are getting cut off (even ones from long ago) and users are not being informed when their comments surpass the character limit. Also, they are allowed to post a comment even if it exceeds the character limit. This causes the comment to get cut off with ""..."" at the point where the character limit was reached.

I suggest making the character limit much longer (like 5000), adding a ""See More"" button after a certain number of characters (like 500) and informing users that their comments have surpassed the character limit by turning the text red and adding a negative number in red (for the number of characters which surpass the character limit) to the bottom right corner of the comment input field plus showing an error message if users try to post a comment which surpasses the character limit.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Post a really long comment, one which exceeds the current character count for comments (whatever it is)

### Platform information 

Chrome/Win10

--->

### Summary

This bug is driving me nuts. Please fix it asap. Every time a new message is received in messenger in real-time it copies the previous 11 or so. It is copying both sent and received messages. I think it's treating it as if it's the first time the chat window has been opened, simply loading the previous 11 sent/received messages but not realizing that those previous messages have already loaded. It should only load the new message(s).

### Steps to reproduce

1. Log in to your primary account in Chrome.
2. Log in to your secondary account in Firefox.
3. Send 13 numbered messages (test1, test2, test3, etc.) from your secondary account to your primary account.
4. Send a message from your primary account to your secondary account without closing the chat window.
5. Send another message from your secondary account to your primary account without closing the chat window.

### Platform information 

Chrome/Win10 and Firefox/Win10

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Every time a new message is received in messenger in real-time it copies the previous 11 or so.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should only load the new message(s).

--->

### Summary

When you try to change your password in settings, it will show an error message when the passwords do not match but not when the new ones don't meet the password requirements (which are also nowhere to be found on this page). If the password doesn't meet the requirements, you can still click ""SAVE"" which turns blue so long as the passwords match but it will just keep spinning forever.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to settings in the web app.
2. Go down to ""Account Password"" and type in your current password.
3. Type ""minds"" in both new password fields.
4. Click ""SAVE"".

### Platform information 

Chrome/Win10.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

No error message is displayed. The loading icon where the ""SAVE"" button used to be just keeps spinning forever.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

An error message should be displayed which reads ""Your new password does not meet the requirements."" The ""SAVE"" button should not turn blue and should not be clickable until the new password entered into both fields meets the requirements. Also, the question mark icon which displays the password requirements should be present at the right of the ""Your new password"" input field. See screenshots below.

This issue was raised in the H&S convo-feed by @moonlit45 (see video below)
I was unable to reproduce this problem using the Firefox browser, nor the Chromium browser. I was however able to reproduce it on the Brave browser.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The blog tiles/icons appear as expected, but their corresponding titles are hidden or otherwise not visible.


### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

We should see The blog tiles/icons as well as their corresponding titles.

### Summary

Although some images work, a lot of users are experiencing the comments poster, not allowing them to post. Some of these reports are manifestations of https://gitlab.com/minds/front/issues/1366, users are definitely experiencing a different bug to this.

I believe this to likely be related to state changes on the front-end.

https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/994278672455299072

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to a comments thread
2. Upload the below image
![wp9](/uploads/1ecc518af51bfd3a35e978b09fac2dca/wp9.jpg)
3. Try to post it. - See bug

(while you're here)
4. press delete on the attachment
5. try to post - you will not be able to.

### Platform information 

Reproduced Chromium / Manjaro

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The image can't be posted.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

This should be seamless.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![image](/uploads/d24c1850db8e04f8c60d9bbef3c944c9/image.png)

### Possible fixes

As removing the image, it still cannot be posted, it feels to me like it is more likely to be a front-end state bug. No errors are outputted and the network logs seem to go through fine.

* A new search icon is presented top-right of the channel
* Clicking it launching a search input presented within a modal
* Sear results are displayed within the normal search results page
  * This avoids creating a clone of search results within the channel.
  * allows users to initiate a channel search from anywhere within the UI. e.g. search `channel:jack snowboarding`

- modal https://www.sketch.com/s/c8a846a2-578c-4ed6-8933-553593021ce5/a/YGnZv0L

- channel search results: https://www.sketch.com/s/c8a846a2-578c-4ed6-8933-553593021ce5/a/dl1w5Gb

### Original issue

When a user is on a specific group or channel page, and they click to search, there should be two options in the dropdown. 

For example, if you search ""open source"" while browsing Mark's channel, the search drop down should give two options:

- ""open source"" - Search Minds
- ""open source"" - Search @mark's channel

This logic should also apply for groups. If you are browsing the Help & Support group, the search options should say:

- ""open source"" - Search Minds
- ""open source"" - Search Help & Support group

If you click to Search Minds, we should give the search results as we do now.

If you click to Search an individual group or channel, we should query only the content within that group, and provide search results in the same layout, but only with results specific to that group.",3
22162189,2019-06-22 21:33:39.642,(bug): NSFW tags on activities not propagating to their entity,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

It appears that when a post is made NSFW, the change is not going down the chain to the actual image entity. The effect of this is that when the image entity is loaded for the image endpoints, it does not have any data under nsfw, so shows up anyway.

This is also likely responsible for reports of NSFW in sidebars. 

https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/988929333995732992 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make an NSFW image post (check pornography & nudity)
2. Check it out in your gallery - if you see an unblurred image, therein lies your bug.

Further investigation:
1. Spin up minds console
2. Run the below


```
use Minds\Core;
use Minds\Entities;

$db = new Core\Data\Call('entities_by_time');
$activities = $db->getRow(""activity:entitylink:997902097930260493"");
var_dump($activities);

$activity = new Entities\Activity($activities[0]);
var_dump($activity);
```

See the NSFW changes did not propagate to the image entity.

### Platform information 

Web - cross platform

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

NSFW content is visible.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should not be.

Many bloggers like to save drafts or publish blogs as unlisted before making them public so they can work on them. If you save a draft, or publish as unlisted, and eventually try to publish the blog to public, then it does not generate an activity post.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Write a blog
2. Save as draft (can try doing this twice)
3. go back to edit blog and publish as public. 
4. No activity post created

1. Write a blog
2. Publish as unlisted
3. go back and edit blog and publish as public
4. no activity post created

### Platform information 

All

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

An activity post should be created everytime you publish a blog as ""Pubic"" no matter what the state of the blog was prior.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The period breaks the @ tag so tagging users with periods in their usernames is impossible.

Figma designs -> https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=1045%3A20030

* The SuperMind (console) is accessible via the `More Menu` within the main navigation.
* Users will also be directed here from email and push notifications.
* This SuperMind console is separate from the Boost console.
  * This console displays only the incoming requests [Requests received](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=319%3A12073)
  * And outgoing requests [Requests sent](https://www.figma.com/file/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?node-id=338%3A12739)
* The settings icon contained within the above designs will link directly to the SuperMind settings (within the Settings Area).

**Requests Received**

* A user may either reply to a request, or choose to reject it.
* A producer has \[72 hours\] to respond to a request.
* Any expired request will disappear from `Requests Received`
* Requests are ordered from new -> old.
* Each request will also display any meta data relevant to the request.
  * Offer amount
  * Twitter post
  * Content type: Text, Video, Image, Remind.
* If the user clicks reject, funds are refunded to the consumer and a notification sent (As detailed within notification)
* Where the user clicks reply, the composer is launched.
  * Note: If the is the users first-time replying to a SuperMind request, they will need to read and agree to the relevant terms of user.
  * After doing so, they’ll then be directed to the composer.
  * If there’s there are specific content requirements, this could be communicated within the placeholder copy. (e.g. video required).
* Workflow for the above detailed here -> [Accept request workflow with T&Cs](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=319%3A12073&viewport=857%2C575%2C0.13&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=319%3A12073)

--->

### Summary

Legacy boost prompt that allows payment in USD still appears sometimes.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click boost on your post and notice the token prompt (this is correct behavior)
2. Go to someone else's channel and click to Wire them on a post. 
3. Toggle over to send them USD. 
4. Exit wire prompt without making payment.
5. Go back to your channel and click boost on your post. 
6. Notice the legacy USD prompt - this should be removed and never show up

### Platform information 

iOS Catalina, MacBook, Chrome

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Only the token boost prompt should ever appear.

the page that loads after clicking on ""Unsubscribe"" link in the email shows empty @ handle currently. 
If I have to try once more to unsubscribe from your list, I'll report you to whatever authority this falls under.
I am sure you realize how bad you look if such simple thing cannot be handled properly by your developers. I have no trust in you as software platform.


Brave browser, on android phones, also on different computers. 
The page after loading says that I am successfully unsubscribed (!) but the handle it displays stays empty in my case. My guess is that using special characters in username is an overkill for your developers. Why do you allow these characters if you dont encode them? Why did no-one write unit tests for these things? Or even worse, did anyone?
I repeat that i was trying to unsubscribe for probably over a year now - isn't that pretty bad experience?

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

When using a browser that is based on the Blink rendering engine (ie. Chromium based), videos that are using the Minds video player fail to display volume control.

### Steps to reproduce
Access the following URLs within a Blink based browser.

### Platform information 

Tested with:
* Chromium (x86_64 - v79.0 - Blink)
* Opera (x86_64 - v65.0 - Blink)
* Brave (x86_64 - v1.0.1 - Blink)
* Firefox (x86_64 - v70.0 - Quantum)
* Midori (x86_64 - v69.0 - Webkit)

Firefox and Midori works fine. Chromium, Brave and Opera fails. Suspect that all Blink / Chromium based browsers are affected with this issue.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
Volume control appears and then suddenly disappears, which results in no access to said control / UI element.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
Volume control / UI element should be accessible

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![audiobug](/uploads/004c5f2e690b9e3305ea532a8bc705a8/audiobug.mp4)

### Possible fixes
Suspect possible CSS issue. Possibly caused by a stylestyle that contains something similar to the following code:
`.element{display:none;}`

Alternatively, some php or javascript issue which results in the above outcome.",4

### Platform information
 
Cross-platform web.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
