102943207,2022-02-23 17:09:27.898,Register modal improvements,"We can improve the user experience with the Register modal -- and possibly improve signup conversions -- by addressing these UX issues with the production modal.

[This Figma jam board](https://www.figma.com/file/Tf7tRLoUqUWFADEsoZAaQK/Register-modal?node-id=0%3A1) highlights some of the issues visually.

1. Field validation warnings (e.g. `Must be at least 4 characters long` and `Invalid email`) change the height of the modal when they appear / disappear.

---

2. When inputting a password, the password rules overlay the fields below, including the `Confirm your password` field, making it unclear what the user should do after entering a valid password. (Note: The rules appear to disappear after the rules are successfully met.) On a mobile device, the rules are likely covered by the on screen keyboard.

---

3. On mobile devices, the `Switch to App` prompt overlays the Register modal.


### Proposed changes to registration modal

- [ ] Present `Password` and `Confirm Password` always. Currently `Confirm Password` only shows when `password` is not NULL
- [ ] Always show CAPTCHA. Currently it only shows once passwords have been entered.
- [ ] Position the captcha image and captcha input side by side as to save space vertically.
- [ ] Remove / hide the `Switch to App` prompt when modals are displayed.
- [ ] Reposition validation message to the same row as the form label, saving vertical space.
- [ ] Remove header image from modal.
- [ ] Position password rules above the input rather than below.
- [ ] Check/Update Cypress testing to account for changes.

- Classic homepage + changes above: 50%

## Acceptance

- [ ] Homepage for logged-out users matches the visuals and copy changes in the Figma mocks linked above.
- [ ] Clicking the `Join Minds` button in the header, or blue `Join Minds Now` buttons on the page displays the user registration modal.
- [ ] Clicking the `Login` button in the header displays the user login modal.
- [ ] Clicking the `Download Android App` button navigates the user to minds.com/mobile.
- [ ] Clicking the `Download iOS App` button navigates the user to the iOS App Store listing for Minds.
- [ ] The page layout responsively adapts to all common browser widths.
- [ ] The page DOM satisfies the SEO considerations described above.
- [ ] The new page is deployed as a Growthbook experiment with the distribution percentages described above.",5

### Hypothesis

Defaulting the Guest Mode homepage to Light Mode may improve user signup conversions.

`Has signed up` in GrowthBook.

### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?

- Classic homepage: 3.72%
- Guest Mode (dark mode): 3.39%

We'd like to improve Guest Mode with light mode to perform as good or better than the classic page.

### How does this change affect the desired metric?

Dark mode may not appeal to all users, who start with an assumption of light-background websites.",1

### Target problem

We have a persistent backlog of Open Boost orders that we're unable to fulfill. Few users opt into viewing Open Boosts, so inventory remains low.

If a Boost order gets slotted into Open and can't fulfill within a certain timeframe, the order gets cancelled and the user refunded their tokens.

### Hypothesis

We can significantly increase the number of users opted into Open Boosts if we use their Build Your Algorithm preference responses to automatically opt them into Open Boosts. By increasing the # of users opted into Open Boosts, we'll increase inventory and reduce the backlog, and in turn reducing the number of rejected Boost orders.

### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?

Open Boosts inventory

### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?

Unknown

### How does this change affect the desired metric?

### What counter metric will ensure that an increase in the primary metric is a positive for the product?

* It has been advised by @markeharding that the context will not be able for the first iteration of recommendations. This will be addressed moving forward.
* The sidebar channel recommendation widget should be removed from the newsfeed.
* Clicking 'See more' will bring the user to `/discovery/suggestions/user`
* When displaying the description, any line breaks should be removed. There should be a character limit of around 120 characters, allows two lines of text to be displayed on desktop.
* Where there is no channel description or context, the channel name and avatar should align. See the example of a channel with no description in the figma link above.

* Where a user has zero subscriptions, a single channel recommendation component should be displayed -> https://www.figma.com/proto/c37p1Jz209IT8vRuc1AoFv/Recommendations?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=129%3A2533&viewport=241%2C48%2C1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=2%3A981&show-proto-sidebar=1

From the original Gitlab issue, but now will be separated into another task for another time:

* ~~The same channel recommendation should only be shown once when viewing the newsfeed. If in 'impression 1', @userA is recommended, @userA will not appear in any future impression within that feed.~~
* ~~It has yet to be determined how frequently we display these impressions. It makes sense to display quite quickly towards the top of the feed, then at wider intervals moving down the feed. e.g. `5th position`, then every 20 positions thereafter. Too many impressions could be quite noisy, so best not to overload the feed. Discuss.~~",8

Background:

### Target problem

The changes to the Newsfeed are targeted at all users and aimed to improve the relevance of the first posts the user sees when visiting the Newsfeed.

### Hypothesis

By prioritizing ""Top"" posts for all users, we can improve relevance of the first-seen posts on the Newsfeed. However, Minds users greatly value their traditional chronological ""Latest"" feeds. So we want to introduce a new default view of the Newsfeed that combines elements of ""Top"" with the traditional ""Latest"" feed.

We're mindful of potential backlash from a subset of Minds users who don't want the ""Top"" posts summary, so we'll offer them the option to view their old feed. For users who prefer the ""Top"" sorting, we'll give them the option to see a Newsfeed completely organized by ""Top,"" not just the condensed view of the default Newsfeed.

### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?

- Engagement on the Newsfeed (likes, comments)
- Duration of sessions on the Newsfeed

### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?

Unknown

### How does this change affect the desired metric?

With the new ""Top"" widget in the default Newsfeed view, we ensure that users see (a) content that they haven't seen before, and (b) content that is most likely to be engaging.

### What counter metric will ensure that an increase in the primary metric is a positive for the product?

We should measure the % of users who set a preference for the ""Latest""-only feed, as a measure of dissatisfaction with the new feature.

100675261,2022-01-14 23:21:35.836,Refactor experiments to use events instead of contexts,"## The Problem

Currently all users are bucketed into experiments on app initialisation and not when they actually see the experiment. This was done so that pageviews could register the experiments as contexts when someone lands on the site. 

Issues arise when experiment reports rely on only including users who have seen the experiment to be included. For example, an experiment that forwards users to discovery instead of the newsfeed after registration should not just only include users that have just signed up, it should also only apply to users that do not have any referral logic (ie. take newly loggedin/registered users back to previous page). 

## Proposed change

- [x] Create a new iglu schema `growthbook_event` which includes the experiment_id that the user is in
- [x] Remove backend registration and client on init logic
- [x] Record a `growthbook_event` via snowplow when an experiment is run
- [x] To avoid unnecessary events, cache a reference to the events so that they only get sent every 24 hours.
- [x] Now that we support psuedo_id, attach both the anonymous_id and user_id to growthbook events",8

### Summary

Google Search Console is still reporting a high number of URLs that we submit in our sitemaps but report as 404 status codes when Google tries to crawl.

![image](/uploads/fc94d69a4ef76be3673a07fb172928cb/image.png)

--->

### Summary

Channel pages that we've intentionally set to return 401 and 404 status codes are appearing in our sitemaps, and are indexable by Google. Google has crawled these pages and reports them as errors in Search Console.

### Steps to reproduce

Google Search Console reports errors for ~7,500 minds.com URLs, reporting these URLs return a 401 error code.

Examples (401'd to avoid spam risk):

- https://www.minds.com/AllThingsStarWars/
- https://www.minds.com/mOnK-FiSh/
- More here: https://search.google.com/search-console/index?resource_id=sc-domain:minds.com

Example (404'd because account deleted):
- https://www.minds.com/MiaPetals/

Cross-reference with our sitemaps to see the URLs appear:

- https://www.minds.com/sitemaps/sitemap2.xml
- https://www.minds.com/sitemaps/sitemap3.xml

View the page source to observe the `robots` tag is set to `all`.

`<meta name=""robots"" content=""all"">`

### Platform information 

(Browser, device, system stats, screen size)

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- We submit these URLs to Google via sitemaps, and robots allows Google to crawl the URLs

### Possible fixes

I assume two possible directions to solve for Search Console reporting the error. 

1. Remove these URLs from our sitemaps
2. Set `robots` tag to `noindex` on these pages",1

There are duplicated translation efforts: POEditor.com and CrowdIn.com!

### Steps to reproduce

As it seems there are two places to translate Minds GUI/API and they are independent. In my Language Hungarian, POeditor seems to be in work for years, but far from complete and low quality. In CrowdIn I made it from scratch to 100%, high quality.

This divides efforts and I guess only one of them will be included in Minds source code!

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

I have read and agree to the [Terms](url) and confirm that I have all necessary rights with regard to any data, information or other material (“Stored Material”) which I post or upload to Minds and the Arweave network (or Permaweb). I also understand that this content cannot be deleted from the Permaweb.

![image__2_](/uploads/80ea8fe6ea892f177bf175688b4227f6/image__2_.png) 

## Full Terms 

By using the Application for the first time (and each time that you then use it) you acknowledge that:

the Application is a tool enabling data to be uploaded to the Arweave public access network (Permaweb), but your right and ability to make any upload is entirely outside our control and depends (among other factors) on the availability of storage capacity which is provided by other independent Users and not by Arweave, protocols applicable to data storage in the network and the facilitation of each upload by determination of the current community of Users of the network;

we give no assurance whatever that the network will be available for any specific time, or that storage capacity at least equivalent;

the network may be unavailable for various reasons including (i) hardware or software failure, malfunction or outages; (ii) misuse of the Application or the network by other Users; or (iii) an Event Outside Our Control.

STORAGE OF DATA

Each time that you use the Application, it is your responsibility alone to make sure that you have all necessary rights with regard to any data, information or other material (“Stored Material”) which you choose to post or upload to the Arweave network.

WE DO NOT OWN, CONTROL OR ENDORSE ANY STORED MATERIAL THAT IS POSTED, TRANSMITTED, STORED, OR PROCESSED IN THE ARWEAVE NETWORK. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHTS OR TECHNICAL ABILITY TO MODIFY OR REMOVE (IN WHOLE OR PART) ANY STORED MATERIAL. 

We do not:

claim any ownership over or other rights in the Stored Material you post or upload to the Arweave network 

monitor postings to the network for compliance with (or infringement of) 3rd party rights; or

monitor postings to the network for compliance with (or breach of) the commitments you agree to about the nature of Stored Material (see next sections).

Each time that you use the Application to post or upload to the Arweave network, you make a commitment to us and to all other Users that you have all necessary rights with regard to the data, information or other material comprised in that Stored Material. Specifically, you are solely responsible to ensure that your Stored Material will not violate any agreements or confidentiality obligations, and will not infringe any intellectual property right or other legal right, including the right of privacy, of any person or entity.

Each time that you use the Application to post or upload to the Arweave network, you make a commitment to us and to all other Users that you will not (and will not knowingly allow others to) create, post, share or store Stored Material that is libellous, defamatory, harassing, threatening, or invasive of privacy rights. 

You acknowledge that:

no other User has any obligation to review, screen, edit or monitor your proposed Stored Material;

the right and ability of any User to post material to the Arweave network is subject to potential prior peer review by all other then Users, and if a majority of those Users who express a response determine for any reason that the proposed material should not become Stored Material, it may not be accepted into the Arweave network; and 

neither we nor any other User has or will have any liability to you (or person working with or through you) for declining to accept materials into the network. 

Minds and Arweave reserve the right to pursue available legal recourse against you or other persons with regard to costs and damages incurred by Arweave or any of our affiliates resulting from malicious breach by you or persons working with or through you of the commitments you agree to about the nature of Stored Material.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

You acknowledge that the Application has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Application meet your requirements.

We shall not in any circumstances whatever be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with the Licence for loss of profits, sales, business, or revenue; business interruption; loss or corruption of data or information; loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation; or any indirect or consequential loss or damage.

Other than the losses set out in Condition 5.2 (for which we are not liable), our maximum aggregate liability under or in connection with this Licence whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in all circumstances be limited to GBP 1000.00/US$ 1500.00. This maximum cap does not apply to Condition 5.5.

Nothing in this Licence shall limit or exclude our liability for any liability that cannot be excluded or limited by English law.

COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US  

If you wish to contact us in writing, you can send this to us by e-mail at info@minds.com or mail at PO Box 7681, Wilton, CT 06897.

EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL  

We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this Licence or for the reduction, suspension or total cessation of functionality of the Application that is caused by an Event Outside Our Control. An Event Outside Our Control means any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation failure of public or private telecommunications networks.

If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of, or causes the reduction, suspension or total cessation of functionality of the Application our responsibility (if any) to you and all other Users of the Application will be fully suspended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  

We will only use your personal information as set out in our most recent privacy policy.",2

### Summary

The website doesn't seem to have an ""about us"" page. Currently, the closest thing to an ""about us"" page is the Whitepaper. This content is certainly relevant, but since it's a PDF it will not have the best opportunity to rank, and in this particular case, the search engine isn't even indexing the Mind's Whitepaper. Is there any data on the current engagement for this page on analytics? 

Also, from a user experience standpoint, the content of the Whitepaper is long and most users won't consider reading through it. Creating a concise “about us” landing page that can be crawled and indexed on search engines will drive traffic to Mind's website and also give people a simple way to learn about Minds before they sign up. 

----

As Guest mode will replace the current logged-out Minds.com homepage contents with preview newsfeed, and we want to keep the contents of the current page available, we should relocate the page to minds.com/about URL.

Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->

Now that we have achieved general consensus with Nostr devs on [NIP-26](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/28) we can temporarily disregard our former [Whitelist](https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/3306) proposal for ingestion and build the initial implementation of NIP-26 (which is required for the MR to be accepted anyway). 

- Add section in Settings, under Account called Nostr
- Subsections will be Add relay, Delegate key, Generate key
- For the usecase of users with existing Nostr keypair, this section will have an input field for a token to establish the pairing of their key with the Minds delegated key
- For the usecase of users without existing Nostr keypair, this section will have an option to generate and download or copy a new Nostr keypair similar to the setup field on branle
- For the usecase of adding relays to post to, this section will enable users to add more like in other clients

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed

## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.

### Summary

Occasionally, top post push notifications read:

> @username posted

These notifications are pretty vague and I think can be improved by always having a bit more context.

### Steps to reproduce

- Enable notifications for `Top Posts`
- Wait for a daily push top post push notification

### Platform information 

iOS, Mac + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The push notification reads:

> @username posted

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Depending on the type of post that's being promoted, more context is expected.

I initially thought this was happening when the top post was a media post without any text. But in the example screenshot above, it's from Babylon Bee and looking at their post history I don't see any posts without text.

They are all posts with links, however -- which may be indicative of the cause.

Let's assume this post was being sent as a top post push notification:

SQLAlchemy `insert` operators are lazy instantiated, which means that they may trigger exceptions not at the point of creation, but at the point of use. When placed into a worker queue, these delayed exceptions may kill worker threads.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a SQLAlchemy `insert` operator with incompatible values argument. Place in worker queue. Worker triggers `sqlalchemy.exc.CompileError` exception, and exits.

### Platform information 

Data ETL

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

ETL pipeline fails

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

ETL pipeline doesn't fail

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

## Goal

Increase boost inventory.

## What needs to be done

Add in-feed boost placements to the Discovery > Top feed, using the same spacing logic as used on the Newsfeed.

Note: This does NOT include the Boost rotator.

## QA

<!---

110987996,2022-06-30 21:25:38.421,Activities v2: Boost rotator improvements,"## Goal

Address the following UX concerns with respect the Boost Rotator in the context of the new activity post designs.

1. The social interactions at the bottom of the rotator get pushed outside the confines of the boost rotator when posts are lengthy.
2. The presentation of the post content within the boost rotator is oftentimes poorly presented.
3. The navigation controls (more left/right) are perceived to be lost/unclear


## What needs to be done

- [ ] Address the above three issues as indicated in the UX/Design heading 

### Other bugs that should be research / resolved as part of this issue MAKE NEW TASKS PLEASE

- [ ] The rotator shows horizontal scroll bars for quote posts
- [ ] Videos don't autoplay within the boost rotator
- [ ] When just a youtube link is contained within the post, the video embed does not appear. Just the link is displayed.

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed

## UX/Design

1. [New Boost Rotator Header](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=707%3A3838)
  * Larger clearer boost rotator header with its own BG colour.
  * Larger nav controls moved to the RHS
2. [Social Interactions](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=818%3A3769)
  * Social interaction should remain in a fixed position at the bottom on the boost rotator.
  * The length height of the boosted post should not impact upon the position of the social interactions.
  * Where content overruns a slight gradient fadeout appears as indicated in the above design link.
  * Clicking `See More` will navigate the user to the post page
3. [Revised content positioning](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=808%3A3662)
  * Content should be positioned in the middle of the available area between the post header and social interactions.
  * Where there is text with an embed (URL, Image, Video) the [associated text should sit alongside the embed](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=808%3A3725).
  * See below numerous design examples which should clarify this.
    * [Text and image not overflowing](https://www.figma.com/file/oYPYya9Z4G5wqgLvdKDbOB/Activity-Post-revised-%5BWeb%5D?node-id=707%3A3838)

## Goal

Enable onboarding experiments with the Discovery > Top feed by bringing Newfeed features targeted at new users to the Discovery feed.

## What needs to be done

Enable all in-feed notices to appear on the Discovery > Top feed, by the same logic with which they can currently appear on the Newsfeed.

For reference, [this is the order in which activity posts are expected to appear](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FHWiKdYobssgXQt8Cc6l3IyiFwjWnf2_jCc-ObHUsuM/edit#gid=0) (same as Newsfeed).

## Personas

This change is targeted at new Minds users who are curious about the network and want to connect with people with similar interests.

## Experiments

While this change is related to enabling experiments, it is not an experiment itself -- this can be rolled out to 100% of the audience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given an in-feed notice appears on the Newsfeed, and I have not yet dismissed the notice or otherwise completed the criteria that dismiss it, when I visit the Discovery feed, then the same in-feed notice is presented in the same position.

(1) Increase the % of new users with interest tags relevant to their interests, (2) connect new users to channels creating content related to their interests, and (3) be able to analyze new user retention by differentiated interest segments.

## What needs to be done

During onboarding, new users are presented a modal of interest tags to select from. That list includes (in order):

- Art
- Music
- Myphoto
- Photography
- Crypto
- Nature
- Outdoors
- Technology
- Poetry
- Travel
- News
- Journalism
- Sports
- Minds
- Blockchain

Update the list to include these tags instead (in order):

- Animals
- Anime
- Art
- Comedy
- Crypto
- Food
- Freedom
- Gaming
- Literature
- Memes
- Movies
- Music
- Nature
- NSFW
- News
- Outdoors
- Photography
- Politics
- Religion
- Sports
- Technology
- Travel

## Goal

We want to be able to measure the impact of mobile app push notifications -- including activity notifications, top post notifications, and ad-hoc notifications.

## What needs to be done

If the notifications get clicked and launch the app, we should record referrer data to the screen view so that screen view data can be sliced by referrer, e.g.

- UTM source: `minds`
- UTM medium: `push-notification`
- UTM campaign: `ad-hoc` / `top-post` / `activity`

User data should be anonymized.

--->

### Summary

If I share my referral link with someone who already has a `referrer` cookie, and then that user signs up, the newly-registered channel does not appear on my [referrals screen](https://www.minds.com/settings/other/referrals).

### Steps to reproduce

These steps require two users / mimicking two users via separate browser sessions.

As User B...
- Open an incognito window
- Navigate to a minds.com channel page (e.g. https://www.minds.com/airicmusic/) that does not belong to User A

As User A...
- Navigate to minds.com/settings/other/referrals
- Copy the referral link (e.g. https://www.minds.com/register?referrer=mellamomrs)
- Share the link with User B

As User B...
- Follow User A's referral link
- Sign up for a Minds account

As User A...
- Refresh the Referrals page

### Platform information 

- MacOS + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- The newly-registered account does NOT appear on the Referrals page

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- The newly-registered account DOES appear on the Referrals page

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

This was reported by user [Airic (airicmusic)](https://www.minds.com/airicmusic/), who reported helping a friend register the follow account using Airic's referral code.

- https://www.minds.com/drsebison/

### Possible fixes

I propose that we overwrite the `referral` cookie when a user visits a referral link (query parameter).

- Given I am NOT a registered Minds user,
- and I have a `referral` cookie from a prior visit to Minds,
- when I navigate to Minds via a referral link,
- then my `referrer` cookie is overwritten with the GUID of the user referenced in the referral link.",2

## Goal

Support activity posts with multiple images to enable content creators to create content they expect to create on social media.

## What needs to be done

Set up backend to support a new activity post type that contains multiple images. Some assumptions we can make:

- A post can have multiple images (1-4).
- All upvotes / engagements on images within the post are attributed to the post -- in other words, the activity post has one set of engagements; we do not store engagements separately for each image within the post.

Activity:

```
->custom_type = 'batch';
->custom_data = [
  [
     // image one
     'thumbnail_src' => < source to thumbnail 1>
  ],
  [
    // image two
    'thumbnail_src' => < source to thumbnail 2>

## Goal

Communicate the Minds New York event to all active users on the site, and give them the chance to find and more and buy tickets.

## What needs to be done

Create an in-feed notice with low priority that appears for all users, given they haven't already dismissed it.

Note: This in-feed notice is a bit different than others in that (1) the only condition for it to appear is that the user hasn't already dismissed it, (2) it effectively has an expiration date on it (we don't need to run it after the event), (3) we will likely want to replace it with another notice with updated messaging as we get closer to the event (e.g. `Learn how to live stream the event`). Just some things to consider for the execution.

## Goal

When a user signs up for a new account, we automate some emails to onboard them into different features on Minds. One is the `Get paid for your posts on Minds` email, which is sent a day after they sign up.

However, we're testing a change to when users are able to join events, a change that puts a 3-day account age requirement ahead of joining rewards.

The goal is to keep the email messaging consistent with the site messaging.

## What needs to be done

Change the timing of the `Get paid` email to be sent 3 days after they've signed up.

## UX/Design

This should use the existing component for in-feed notices.

## Personas

- New users
- Content creators who will benefit from rewards

## Experiments

We should deploy this change via an experiment, with:
- (a) the control variant, in which `Complete to earn tokens` is in the sidebar and no new in-feed notices, and
- (b) the test variant with `Complete to earn tokens` removed form the sidebar and the new in-feed notices introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Backend API that returns the display logic for in feed notices
- [ ] The in-feed notices described above appear in the Newsfeed under the conditions described
- [ ] Each notice launches the appropriate modal that the user can complete
- [ ] When a modal is completed, the in-feed notice is removed from the Newsfeed

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

We want to understand how often users reach the end of feeds, and in what context they reach the end of feeds so that we can identify and prioritize solutions

## What needs to be done

Fire an analytics event when a user reaches a ""Nothing more to load"" message in a feed.

This can happen in:
- Newsfeed
- Channel feed
- Discovery feed
- Search feed
- Group feed
- (and other places)

The event should pass context that allows us to discern:
- Where did the user encounter the end of a feed? Which page / type of feed?
- Which platform was the user on?
- How many posts were they served before seeing the end of the feed?

### The refactor

Deprecate the use of 'click_event'. Replace this with a new event called 'generic_event"".

| name | type | example |
| ------ | ------ | ------  |
| event_type | string | eg. 'click', 'view' |
| event_ref | string | eg. 'topbar-link' |

108026629,2022-05-04 17:28:02.240,Email 2FA modal generates confusing messages,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

The email 2FA modal on web generates some confusing messages, in two scenarios:

1. When the user clicks `Resend` button, then a toaster is displayed with the message `TwoFactor is required`
2. When closing the 2FA  modal, then a toaster is displayed with the message `TypeError: cannot read properties fo undefined (reading 'status')

### Steps to reproduce

Issue #1:

1. Log into an account that does NOT have app-based 2FA configured
2. Navigate to Account > Password screen (https://www.minds.com/settings/account/password) on web
3. Start to change the password by filling in your current password + specifying a new one
4. Click ""Update Password"" to generate the email 2FA modal
5. Click the `Resend` button.

----

Issue \#2:

1. Log into an account that does NOT have app-based 2FA configured
2. Navigate to Account > Email Address (https://www.minds.com/settings/account/email-address) on web
3. Change the email to anything else => fill in your password
4. When the email 2FA modal pops up, dismiss it
5. Notice the toast error that says `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')` (img 2)

### Platform information 

MacOS + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Issue #1:
- A new verification email is sent, and the modal flashes, and the toaster message `TwoFactor is required` is displayed

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

~- A new verification email is sent and the toaster message communicates that the email was sent.~

Handling in https://gitlab.com/minds/front/-/issues/5512 - this is a wider issue than just the error message being incorrect.

Expected behavior
- Get rid of superfluous ""TwoFactor required"" message (as discussed in sprint planning)
- Fix other error dev error message mentioned above

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

Clicking `Resend` generates `TwoFactor is required` toaster message.

![image](/uploads/03635ef30d63b7ef233d94eece552757/image.png)

Closing the modal generates this toaster message.

## Personas

All new users

## Experiments

We should test the impact of switching to Codes for verification -- e.g. to measure do more or fewer or the same percentage of users complete verification. I believe this experiment will be handled with the front end component of this update, and that we don't need a separate test for this email component.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Everyone should be able to understand what is expected to be delivered
--->

- [ ] Code-based verification emails use the newly-defined template
- [ ] The email layout looks good in all major email clients -- some variance is expected, but they should not look broken

## Goal

We need to understand the value of browser push notifications, both to users and to Minds.

## What needs to be done

Enable the measurement push notification clicks.

Given the assumption that clicking a push notification opens a web URL, a possible solution is adding `utm` parameters to URLs for push notifications.

Consider using `onClick` from the service worker to avoid utm codes. Use existing snowplow click event.

106997489,2022-04-21 21:45:03.345,Minds URLs often time out before share metadata is returned,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

When sharing minds.com URLs on third party sites that read open graph tags and other metadata to generate URL previews, the minds.com URL often times out.

### Steps to reproduce

- [Check a minds.com URL on Schema.org's validator](https://validator.schema.org/#url=http%3A%2F%2Fdebug.iframely.com%2F%3Furi%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.minds.com%252Fnewsfeed%252F1362763459632042002)
- [Check a minds.com URL on Iframely's debugger](http://debug.iframely.com/?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minds.com%2Fnewsfeed%2F1362763459632042002)

### Platform information 

- MacOS + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- Validators (as linked above) often return only partial metadata results
- Third party sites like Twitter often generate incomplete previews of minds.com URLs

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- Validators reliably read all relevant metadata
- Third party sites like Twitter reliably generate complete previews

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

Iframely with partial metadata returned:
![image](/uploads/0c7ab919fa5d02fb2ec4e37f97dfd855/image.png)

Iframely with complete metadata returned:
![image](/uploads/8d6711ff2d84a54f0575272dfe385726/image.png)

Note that in the second screenshot, oEmbed and Open Graph tabs appear, and the GIF media on the page is played.

### Possible fixes

I don't have a fix in mind, but guess that it's related to client-side rendering of pages. The initial document we serve from the server contains only partial metadata -- the rest of the metadata, including open graph tags, is rendered client side, which may get delayed / may happen too slowly for whatever timeout standards these sites use.",2

106934984,2022-04-20 21:22:58.769,In-feed notice: Update your interests tags,"## Goal
- Increase the % of active users who have relevant interest tags selected.
- Given the recommendations algorithm Tasman is working on, this will improve both (1) the predictiveness of the recommendations, and (2) the ability to reach users with the recommendations.

## What needs to be done
Using the in-feed notices component we created, make a new notice that prompts users to update their interest tags, given the user matches conditions specified below. Clicking the modal will launch the existing Content Settings modal, allowing the user to select their interest tags, save, and close the modal to continue using the Newsfeed.

## Experiments
This does not need to be deployed via experiment.

### Dev notes

Discovery hashtags api endpoint includes all tag information.

## Acceptance
- [ ] Create a new in-feed notice that, given the correct conditions described below, can appear in the Newsfeed.
- [ ] The notice will prompt users to update their interest tags.
- [ ] The prompt will launch the Content Settings modal that lets users set their preferences.
- [ ] The prompt is dismissable.
- [ ] The prompt should show **only** to users who have not got any tags selected

105465186,2022-03-24 22:28:40.748,Standardize sidebar components for feeds,"To make the site more predictable and enable better A-B test controls, we should standardize the components that appear for logged-in users in the sidebar of feeds including:

- Newsfeed
- Discovery feeds
- Search feeds

This table outlines the different sidebar components, which appear in which feed *currently*, and which should appear in the new shared, standardized layout. Numbers represent the order of appearance, from top to bottom.

| Component                          | Newsfeed | Discovery | Standardized |
|------------------------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Complete to earn tokens            | 1        |           | 1            |
| The community-owned social network |          | 1         |              |
| Boost (channel)                    | 2        |           | 3            |
| Trending tags                      | 3        | 2         | 2            |
| Suggested channels                 |          |           |              |
| Boost (post)                       | 4        |           | 4            |

## Acceptance

- [ ] As a logged-in user, when viewing the Newsfeed, Discovery feeds, or Search feeds on a desktop browser, the sidebar displays the same components, in the same order.
- [ ] The contents of `Suggested channels` and `Trending tags` components are contextually matched to the feed they appear against.",1

## Acceptance

- [ ] When a user encounters a hideable in-feed component, they have an interface that lets them choose to hide the component.
- [ ] If the user chooses to hide the component, the component disappears from the page.
- [ ] Every time the user visits a feed during their logged in session, the in-feed channel recommendations component does not appear.
- [ ] If the user chooses to hide in-feed channel recommendations, this DOES NOT impact their appearance in dynamic contexts such as when it appears after clicking the subscribe button.

105220564,2022-03-21 16:49:08.042,Users are clicking expired email verification links,"### Target problem

A high percentage of users who create accounts on Minds don't use the app after 2 hours. Tasman has identified a common pattern with these users:

- They haven't verified their email address
- They have multiple events showing them clicking the ""Resend"" button on email verification

### Hypothesis

- Verification emails end up in the user's spam folder and get missed
- If a user clicks ""Resend"" and later finds the emails in their spam folder, they may follow a verification link in an older verification email -- which will have expired and give them an error.

- [ ] Re-using the same verification link rather than generating a new one every time the user clicks ""resend,"" will result in a higher % of users who register. OR not expiring previous verification links after a new one is sent will have the same effect.

### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?

Daily registrations (email verifications) / Daily signups (new accounts created), can be measured in the [Growth Dashboard](https://analytics.minds.com/superset/dashboard/32/?native_filters=%28NATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%3A%28__cache%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2CextraFormData%3A%28filters%3A%21%28%28col%3Aaccount_type%2Cop%3AIN%2Cval%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%29%29%2CfilterState%3A%28label%3AAuthentic%2CvalidateMessage%3A%21f%2CvalidateStatus%3A%21f%2Cvalue%3A%21%28Authentic%29%29%2Cid%3ANATIVE_FILTER-jhvp9Gs1E%2CownState%3A%28%29%29%29).

### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?

Currently conversion is ~30%; 90%+ seems like a realistic goal for an action with such strong intent as signup.

### Size estimate

(Size estimate -- from Design + Dev -- required to deliver this change. Is just an estimate)

### Acceptance
- [ ] If the user generates multiple verification emails via the ""Resend"" button, following the `Verify Address` button in any email will verify the user's address.
- [ ] Keep links valid for 24 hours",3
105219430,2022-03-21 16:27:03.920,Ad-hoc push notifications tool / interface,"### Target problem
Most Minds app users do not get frequent push notifications because they don't get daily engagement on their content. Because many are not reminded of Minds through notifications, they forget to check into the app daily.

### Hypothesis

By sending more regular general push notifications (e.g. Watch Minds on Joe Rogan), we can remind many users to check into Minds daily.

### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?

DAU, Check-ins

### What counter metric will ensure that an increase in the primary metric is a positive for the product?

% of users with push notifications enabled / Minds has access to send them notifications

### Size estimate

(Size estimate -- from Design + Dev -- required to deliver this change. Is just an estimate)

### Acceptance Criteria

- API endpoint (restricted to only admins) to trigger ad-hoc push notifications
- API to support basic reporting of notification
- CLI for testing and/or manual triggers
- Abstraction of sender lists for future targeting support. Initial implementation to go to all devices
- Backend runner to subscribe to events
- Fields to support Title, Message, Link/URI
- Database to store (timestamp, author, title, body, uri, counter, status)
- Frontend to live in admin panel",13

104974153,2022-03-17 06:50:07.090,Regenerative Recommendations,"### Target problem

channel recommendations previously had horizontal scrolling which made it easier for the user to see more recommendations. But now we only show three.

### Hypothesis

When the user chooses to subscribe to any recommendations, It's a good opportunity to show them more recommendations. There are two ways we can do this:

1. easy: replace the recommendation by another rec
2. complex: replace the recommendation by another rec and also grow the recommendation widget to a size of 5

### What is the primary metric that this change is aimed to improve?

channels subscribed
channels subscribed / channel recommendation widget shown

### What is the current state of this metric, and what is the improvement goal?

(Current value of the metric, target value of the metric)

### How does this change affect the desired metric?

104958117,2022-03-16 23:00:55.497,Improve Open Graph content for referral URLs,"In order to improve the conversion of referral links, we should optimize the contents of the Open Graph tags on URLs that contain referral tags.

When copying a referral URL from the [Settings > Referrals screen](https://www.minds.com/settings/other/referrals), the app appends a referrer parameter to the URL for the minds.com/register page.

`https://www.minds.com/register?referrer=mellamomrs`

We should optimize the OG tags for this URL when the referrer param is present.

![image](/uploads/dfa9b1bce873c98d0ae022c0f2051e03/image.png)

## Improved Open Graph spec

The basic gist is pulling in the name and avatar of the user who's username is in the referrer parameter. If the referrer parameter is blank or references a username that doesn't exist, OG tags can fall back to the default

## Goal

Better connect people to each other (grow channel subscriptions) by providing highly relevant social proof of a channel's relevance to a user.

## What needs to be done

Add a new component to channel pages that indicates that channels you follow also follow the channel you're viewing.

Example:
- I follow Bill and Jack
- Bill and Jack follow Mark
- When viewing Mark's channel page, the new component indicates that Bill and Jack follow Mark

104635452,2022-03-11 18:21:05.849,h1 on new homepage,"The spec for the new homepage included wrapping the Minds logo in an h1 tag. That turned out to be contentious, so spinning off a separate task to discuss / implement a final solution.

----

The goal is to have an H1 on the page that semantically reads ""Minds"" for search purposes. This will help reinforce the page title tag so that the page continues to rank for the search query `minds`. It is imperative that Minds continues to rank #1 for the search query `minds`, which is responsible for [most of our search referrals](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/525f323a-f2b5-47ea-82ad-181972a5ebd3/page/39caC).

Since we don't have a non-logo version of the word ""Minds"" on the new homepage, wrapping the Minds logo in an h1 and applying the `alt=""Minds""` tag to the logo image is an option for achieving the goal.

### Summary

On mobile web, we present the user the option to connect to Metamask. However, the button doesn't allow me to follow through.

### Steps to reproduce

- Install the Metamask app.

- Navigate to `Wallet` and click `Join rewards`
- When the `Connect Wallet` modal appears, click on the Metamask icon

### Platform information 

- iPhone 12 Mini
- iOS 15.3.x

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- The browser navigates to a metamask.com URL and links to the App Store to install the Metamask app.

104131137,2022-03-04 19:29:30.398,"When user reaches the end of the Newsfeed, show Discovery posts","## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->

- Increase content engagement rate
- Increase time on site

It's possible for a user (especially a new user with few channel subscriptions) to reach the end of their Newsfeed. Rather than leaving them with nothing more to scroll, we should inject the Discovery > Top feed into the end of the Newsfeed.

## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->

In the Newsfeed, either in the Top or Latest views, when the user reaches the end of the Newsfeed (nothing more to load), then load in posts from the Discovery > Top feed.

A `Discovery` header visually separates the feed. A 3-dot menu lets the user `Remove from feed` to hide the Discovery injection from the Newsfeed.

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->

...

## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.

_Quick illustration_:

## Personas

<!---
Who does this user impact and why
--->

- Everyone

## Experiments

<!---
Experiments are not required, but it should be made clear if one is expected. If experiments are required, the hypothesis should be outlined.
--->

This change should be deployed as an experiment.

Hypothesis: By adding Discovery to the end of a Newsfeed, we can ensure that the user never runs out of content to scroll through, giving the user opportunity to engage more.

Measure:
- [ ] Upvotes
- [ ] Downvotes (counter metric)
- [ ] Reminds
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Channel subscriptions
- [ ] How many users choose to remove it from the feed

## Acceptance

- [ ] Ensure we use the Explore/Discovery endpoint
- [ ] Lazy load to save angular bundle size
- [ ] Setup the experiment
- [ ] Given a user is on the Newsfeed, when the user scrolls to the end of the Newsfeed (no more posts to), then start loading posts from Discovery > Top feed
- [ ] Visually separate the user's subscribed Newsfeed and the newly-injected Discovery posts with a `Discovery` header.
- [ ] The `feed-end` event only fires if the user reaches the end of the Discovery > Top posts that were added to the Newsfeed.
- [ ] The user can dismiss the component from the ... menu
- [ ] Given the user previously dismissed the component, if the user logs out and logs back in, the component is restored

### Summary

Channel recommendations are empty. This results in (1) no channel recommendations appearing in the sidebar on pages where it is expected, and (2) discovery/suggestions/users page displays a `Nothing more to load` message.

See: https://www.minds.com/discovery/suggestions/user

### Steps to reproduce

- Log into a channel that is subscribed to zero accounts.
- Navigate to https://www.minds.com/discovery/suggestions/user
- Observe that suggested channels are displayed.

## Goal

Ensure that the Newsfeed > Top sort always has plenty of content to display. Currently, depending on the user's subscriptions and view history, it's possible for the Top sort to return as few as 1 posts for the Newsfeed, even if their subscriptions have more than 1 post.

## What needs to be done

- Given a user is on the Newsfeed,
- and the user's subscriptions include posts that are not included in Top-ranked sort,
- when the user scrolls to the last Top-ranked post in their Newsfeed,
- then begin loading posts from the user's subscriptions chronologically.

## QA

## UX/Design

No new designs. We just need to display a ""Latest"" heading above posts that are loaded in chronologically. This should use the same styling / spacing as the Latest heading on the Latest sort of the Newsfeed.

## Personas

- Core users

## Experiments

Does not need an experiment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a user is on the Newsfeed, and the user's subscriptions include posts that are not included in Top-ranked sort, when the user scrolls to the last Top-ranked post in their Newsfeed, then begin loading posts from the user's subscriptions chronologically.

### Summary

I received a notification on my Note 10+ that my boost was rejected. Opened Minds.com direct APK from notification and all notifications were listed with the ""rejected notification"" listed as: ""Can't show this notification"" in red. Below it, it states to 'tap to copy error.'

### Steps to reproduce

Open app from Android notification bar when rejected boost is alerted on system notice tray.

26079176,2019-10-18 12:20:29.522,A/B testing for emailing campaigns,"Each time we change the design/text/timing of emails or notifications we need to measure the performance of the new settings.

The following steps are necessary to conduct a statistically well-founded A/B testing:

*  **Splitting the user base**

    The user base (or the users that we need to perform the experiment on) needs to be randomly split into disjoint groups, **Control** and **Treatment** (several Treatment groups can be created if needed, each one reflects a particular variant in the settings).

   * The Control group will be targeted using the the old original settings before applying the changes.
   * The Treatment group will be targeted with the new settings

    Certain level selection can happens before the randomisation to guarantee a more effective testing (e.g. select the users only in the US).

*  **Deciding the performance measure(s)**

    For each experiment, we have to define the performance measure(s) we need to track. Example: in the welcome email, the performance measure could be the convergence rate (i.e. the ratio of users clicked on a link in the email to go to Minds).
 
*  **Labeling and tracking actions**

    Based on the performance measure(s), we will implement tracking mechanisms that allow us to perform the calculations (e.g. the group of the user and if clicked on a button or not).

    *  Each setting and each user group needs to have a unique descriptor to allow identifying the experiment and measure the performance.
    *  Each UI element involved in the tracking the performance has to record wether the user interacted with it or not.

    No need to know user guid, we just need to know the group of that user and his actions.

*  **Performing the experiment**

    The more actions performed by the users in both groups the more the statistical significance will be accurate.

    1,000 user participating from each group can be statistically sufficient to make a judgement.",4

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary:

'Boost' notifcations usually carry a link to the post. When this post doesn't exist, the notification still comes through. 
This results in all the notifications prior being erased, making the new notifications unresponsive and rendering the rest of the website unresponsive.

The notifications below the unassigned boost notification become empty, and the website becomes seemingly unresponsive, whatever you click on won't open. 

The bug seems to be because of the unassigned 'Boost' notification. Because this specific notification is only visible in the 'all notifcation' tab, the other tabs (votes, subscribers, comments etc.) are not affected.
When the unassigned 'Boost' notification gets burried by other notifications, the site will not break unless you load it by scrolling down to it.

To explain the bug in simple terms:
When you boost a post, you can delete that post. The boost notification will point at a deleted post, find nothing and break the website through the notification system. 
Because of the way minds caches posts, a deleted post can and will still be processed. After deleting the post you made a timebomb that will break your notification system.

### Steps to reproduce:

1.  Create a media post on your profile (image)

2.  Boost the post on your profile (must be of type Newsfeed)

3.  Delete the post permanently on your profile

4.  Revoke the boosted post in the Boost Console (this will also happen if boost approved or rejected).

5. Check the notification window, it should behave incorrectly and show critical damage to the website

### Browser and OS

Mozilla Firefox 68.0 reported by: @aobachan

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Screenshot should be self explanatory.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

If a notification is somehow corrupted and causing an issue, the front end should simply be able to disregard it, though the underlying cause here needs to be investigated and amended.

### Summary:

> The click area for the mouse on the upvote button beneath the posts is so small (maybe just the height), i always do accidentally open the linked article or detail view of the post. It's annoying.

This could possibly be solved by having rich embed text change colour on hover, like the like button already does. It could also be redesigned visually and have a thin border box or something alike.

Click a bit around the upvote button.

### Summary

When going between groups the group list doesn't seem to always update the last area you were in to the top of the list. 

### Steps to reproduce
If you have old test groups that you are the sole member of:

1. Post in old test group.
2. Refresh, observe changes to the sidebar.
2. Post in another old group.
4. Refresh and check the order of the top groups - the order appears messed up.

Sometimes this requires a bit of repetition.

### Platform information 

Firefox, Linux & Chromium Ubuntu

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Group sidebar not updating.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Confirmed with @ottman. The correct behavior is that groups should be sorted by latest activity with active gatherings on the top

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

In order to help mitigate the root cause of our recent outage (caused by a flood of relay traffic), we need to implement rate limiting. We can use Redis for this, possibly w/ a library such as [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limiter-flexible).

### Steps to reproduce

Have one socket spam Nostr client with many requests

### Platform information 

Engine

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Nostr is down

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Nostr should be up, we should patch the implementation by rate-limiting requests by Socket ID for now, application-side.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

## Goal

Thank Minds+ and Pro subscribers.

## What needs to be done

Send Bulk Supermind to all current Minds+ and Pro members monetized on Stripe.

- Originating activity post: https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1462583221886652417
- Offer amount: $5
- Reply type: Video
- Email title: `Baste Records sent you a $5 Supermind offer`
- Email copy: `As a Minds+ / Pro subscriber, you are eligible to receive cash Supermind offers from various brands on Minds. Baste Records is offering you $5 to answer a question for them. Give them a sub if you want more from them in the future!`
- Recipients: Minds+ / Pro subscribers who are connected to Stripe

---

- We've budgeted for this campaign to generate ~100 responses
- We should roll out to users who meet the recipient criteria above progressively, so that we don't overshoot the budget (assuming the eligible recipients are more than 100 people)
- We can start by sending it out to 100 eligible recipients, based on how recently they signed up for Minds+ / Pro
- As we understand the response rate for that 100, we can send out to the next batch progressively to hit our target.

117046125,2022-10-17 15:30:45.047,Experiment: Prompt to Supermind when writing a comment,"## Goal

As a user making comments, I want my comments to get attention and engagement from their target.

Goal: Increase Supermind offers.

## What needs to be done

Hypothesis: Users who comment on activity posts of other creators are likely customers of Supermind. We can use the commenting flow to introduce the benefits of Supermind and increase Supermind offers.

Build a prompt that displays when a user is writing a comment that asks them to turn their comment into a Supermind. The prompt can only appear for top-level comments.

- Time the prompt after (a) the user has begun typing a comment, and (b) 5 seconds have passed.
- The prompt appears once for a user during a logged in session.
- Once the prompt has appeared, it will not appear again.

Clicking the prompt launches the Supermind offer screen, and pre-populates the composer afterward with the text that was input into the comment before they pressed the `Upgrade` button.

When the Supermind is posted, the comment input box is reset to blank.

If the Supermind is NOT posted and the Supermind offer / composer is closed, the comment input box is NOT reset to blank.

Cannot submit when the form visually is valid, because the cash offer is too low (even though we're on the token tab)

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- You should be able to submit the token page when everything on the token page is valid, even if the cash page has validation errors.
- You should be able to submit the cash page when everything on the cash page is valid, even if the token page has validation errors.
- **TO DISCUSS** Should the amounts default to the minimum for the user you have selected (as users may set custom minimums) - this made this issue much more apparent however there are UX considerations either way - we should discuss in planning and come to an agreement. If this task is brought in ad-hoc we should discuss in standup.

116027565,2022-09-29 17:05:07.971,Spike: Optimize Supermind links for sharing on Twitter,"## Goal

As a creator, I want to post my Supermind content to Twitter so that my followers are engaged and want to send me more Superminds.

## What needs to be done

Implement Twitter cards (`[Summary Card with Large Image](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image)`) for Supermind replies, and generate 2:1 images to display in those Twitter cards.

Generated images are used to represent the content of the Supermind OFFER post. For offer posts with text, generate a 2:1 text-based graphic. The font size used for the graphic should adjust depending on the character count being shown. Character count should be limited to 280 characters.

For offer posts without any text, generate a 2:1 graphic with media from the post.

| Offer post content | twitter:card        | twitter:site | twitter:creator                   | twitter:title           | twitter:description                                         | twitter:image                                                                                                                   |

116023491,2022-09-29 15:42:29.188,Display offer statuses within Supermind console,"## Goal

Improve usability of the supermind console by allowing the user to filter by type.

The console is currently split into `inbound` and `outbound`. However, within inbound for example, there is no easy way to discern between pending requests, from expired or delivered - consequently it could potentially become quite noisy.

## What needs to be done

Update the display of Supermind offers in the inbox and outbox to indicate their status

Statuses include:
- Pending
- Accepted
- Declined
- Expired
- Failed

Update the buttons displayed under an offer depending on its state.
e.g.

Mobile version has issues with margin spacing on current mobile production. Currently playing around with ideas for mobile and spoke with Jack and Ryan on the topic already, but my suggestion would be to test it out on web first and then move to mobile if received well. I will be following up with the mobile devs to get their opinion on the matter, but it brings up the topic of giving more attention to aligning mobile and web design practices and screens.

115530901,2022-09-21 18:58:39.981,Partial refunds for partial Boost deliveries,"## Goal

Reduce the volume of repeat Boosts by issuing only partial refunds of Boosts that are rejected due to Boost backlog.

## What needs to be done

Currently, a Boost that gets rejected due to Boost backlog overflow will refund to the buyer the full amount of the boost order.

However, most rejected Boosts do deliver views, they're just unable to complete. This is resulting in free Boost views being given to users who spend more than can be delivered during the course of their Boost.

Proposal is to issue partial refunds, rather than full refunds, effectively prorating the refund so that the users are charged for the impressions they were given, even when the order fails to complete.

Example:

| --           | Tokens spent | Views delivered | Refund issued |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Now          | 3,000        | 2,500           | 3,000         |
| After change | 3,000        | 2,500           | 500           |

115529856,2022-09-21 18:40:03.127,Bug: Supermind reply with media only acts as a remind,"### Summary

Responding to a Supermind offer with an image or video -- and no text -- does not successfully generate a Supermind offer. Instead, it simply re-minds the Supermind offer.

### Steps to reproduce

- Receive a Supermind offer
- Accept the the Supermind offer and reply with a piece of media, but no text
- Post the reply

### Platform information 

- Web

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- The Supermind offer is re-minded
- The Supermind reply is lost

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- The Supermind reply is posted with the uploaded media
- See https://gitlab.com/minds/engine/-/blob/master/Entities/Activity.php#L1057. Add in check for attachments.

- Teach active Minds users about Supermind by sending them a sample Supermind to respond to.
- Enable Minds to incentivize content creation from large groups of users.

## What needs to be done

Build a mechanism that enables us to create Supermind offer campaigns that send links to all (or some) users. When a user clicks the link, a Supermind offer is generated for them. They can then respond to the Supermind offer via the normal Supermind inbound console flow.

This is a rough diagram of how it might work.

![image](/uploads/051010be73a8d60a2d74431006f0d807/image.png)

- Target list of users
- Activity post to be the root of the Supermind offer
- Value of the Supermind offer
- Status of the campaign (active, closed, ...)

Some prompts include:

- Introduce yourself :) Why are you on Minds? (Video reply)
- Rant about something crazy going on in the world right now. (Video reply)
- Take a selfie of where you are right now now matter how weird. (Photo reply)
- Introduce yourself :) Why are you on Minds? (Text reply)

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Enable aggressive, confident experimentation with Groups as a vehicle for user retention by refreshing the home feed screen to use modern design system and UI.

## What needs to be done

Refresh the home feed layout for using the modern design system.

- Remove option to start a Gathering.
- Move Make closed, Disable notifications, Report, and Delete group options to a dropdown menu in the header.
- `Members` tab clicks to the existing legacy `Members` screen (with invite functionality)

Assume that functionality available on the members list screen can continue to be served by the existing page without refreshing it, since that page isn't critical to Groups usability for most users and there's a lot of complexity there.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

## Goal

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->

Allow users to show off the groups they belong to without having to add every single group they belong to in their bio. Also, allows subscribers of any user to check out a person's list of groups they belong to and potentially join a group they're in which would help grow the usage and expansion of groups as a whole.


## What needs to be done

<!---
Clearly detail what needs to be done to achieve the goal set out above
--->

We currently have a solution for this built buried behind a user's subscriptions section. We just need to surface this information higher and make it clear for anyone to find.

126516568,2023-04-11 21:22:31.581,UXD: Opt into Groups posts going to Newsfeed,"<!---
Please read this!

The Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

As a Groups user, I want to control which Groups appear in my Newsfeed so that I can freely join Groups without worrying that their high volume will overwhelm my Newsfeed.

## What needs to be done

- Design a solution that enables a Minds user to be a member of a Group, and to manage whether or not posts from that Group appear in their Newsfeed.
- Solve for web + mobile app
- User test designs
- Get developer feedback on solution.

Scenarios to support:

| Group   | Joined | Posts appear in Newsfeed |
|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| Group A | Yes    | Yes                      |
| Group B | Yes    | No                       |
| Group C | No     | No                       |

---

Worth user testing this assumption, but I think we should default to YES for posts appearing in Newsfeed, with the option to disable on a per-group basis.

filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.

## Goal

Make it easier to follow new updates in Groups that I'm subscribed to.

## What needs to be done

- Design solution for displaying posts from subscribed Groups in the Newsfeed.
- Solve for web + mobile app
- User test designs
- Get developer feedback on solution.
- 
----

Some things to consider:

- Do they integrate with posts in the existing Latest & Top newsfeed? Or appear as their own feeds? (I favor the former, ala Reddit & Facebook)
- If they integrate with other posts, do we differentiate posts from Groups or somehow indicate that they came from a Group?

I have a separate task for determining how a user decides which Groups appear in the Newsfeed.

Hi @username,

Hope you're having a great day so far. We wanted to invite some of our awesome community to try out some improvements and tweaks we are making to the product to try and make the experience on Minds that much more smoother.

The link below is a prototype and a quick user task, where we have reworked our referrals program to be a more cohesive experience, and one where expectations are established early in terms of the potential revenue one can earn if they choose to refer! 

[Prototype 1](https://participate.userbrain.com/Z0OQMV)


Once again, thank you so much for your time, and if you have some feedback or thoughts for us, don't hesitate to reach out at @design or @info.

Cheers,

Chaitanya Prashant

Design @ Minds

```
- Participants -> users who have been users of Minds for more than 3 weeks, and were active at least within a 1-3 day window prior to the day our recruitment email gets sent out.

--->

## Goal

Communicate the Minds+ premium content policy in human-readable terms in our Content Policy so that customers can be informed before we begin enforcing the policy.

## What needs to be done

Add a new section to the [Minds Content Policy](https://www.minds.com/content-policy), below `Boost policy` and above `Spam policy`, with the following copy:

---

### Minds+ premium content policy

Minds+ aims to create a unique and engaging feed for its users, and to this end we require that any content monetized through Minds+ is original and exclusive to Minds+. We will not monetize content that exists anywhere else on the internet.

We adhere to US copyright law, including the concepts of ""fair use"" or ""threshold of originality."" We will not monetize content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others or violates any laws, including copyright, trademark, or privacy laws.

To meet the ""threshold of originality"" standard, content must be sufficiently creative and original. We reserve the right to determine whether content meets this standard.

Other restrictions on monetized content also apply. See the [full Minds monetization terms](https://www.minds.com/p/monetization-terms) for more details.

Dos:
- Post original status updates and blogs
- Post original images and videos
- Post original memes derivative of pre-existing memes

Don'ts:
- Re-post memes, photos, videos, or other content others created
- Post content to Minds+ that is available outside of Minds+
- Post NSFW content to Minds+

If you believe that your content has been wrongly rejected or removed, you may contact our support team to appeal the decision. However, we reserve the right to make the final determination regarding the eligibility of content for monetization on Minds+. For more, please see the [Minds Monetization terms of service](https://www.minds.com/p/monetization-terms).

#### Violations

- First violation - Content loses Minds+ premium content status & a strike is earned
- Second violation - Content loses Minds+ premium content status & a strike is earned
- Third violation - Content loses Minds+ premium content status & offender loses the ability to publish Minds+ premium content

124636035,2023-03-02 16:08:38.179,Cannot Boost blog entities,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Blog entities can not be boosted currently - only the activity in your ""all"" filtered channel page or a global feed like the newsfeed and discovery.

# Areas of known failure
- SEP (we seem to be linking through to the entity guid for blogs rather than the GUID when clicking timestamp, thus it fails).
- Blog page.
- Blog filtered channel feed.

### Steps to reproduce

Try to boost a blog from either the filtered channel feed by blog OR from the actual blog page its self.

### Platform information 

Web, likely mobile too.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Cannot Boost a blog from these places because it is not an activity.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

**TBC** - options include

- Have a check in the boost endpoint that looks up linked activities for Blogs and boosts that.
- Export the activity GUID with the blog and Boost the activity GUID from the front end
- Get rid of Boost buttons for these entities / warn on click / redirect to the activity if possible.
- Anything else?

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![image](/uploads/6b1ac25c1b35ae185971781b23c55e91/image.png)

### Possible fixes

Some efforts were undertaken during the development of #3773 (despite being outside of the AC) which are [outlined here](https://gitlab.com/minds/minds/-/issues/3773#note_1299114625) to make the filtered channel page show activities for Boosts - however, this was not possible as there is no indexed value that uniquely identifies blogs under `minds-search-activity`. It was then noticed that this also applies to Boosting directly from the blog page.",3

## Goal

Reduce impact of spam by hiding comments that are suspected of spam.

## What needs to be done

We can automatically identify that comments are spam with a high degree of accuracy, but still want human review before they're removed from the site. When a comment is automatically identified as spam -- but before human review -- we should hide the comments from view, and enable the community to show the comments and give feedback about whether or not the automatic spam detection was accurate.

### Summary

I have looked into superset table for Supermind, and it seems like we have not had an expired Supermind for a while. Latest expired supermind was created on 4th January.

Checking supermind console, I can see that console claims a supermind has been expired, but in the apis it's status 1, Created

### Steps to reproduce

Check Superset and see no Superminds have been expired since 4th of Jan.

### Platform information 

Runners

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Runners seem to be erroring out stopping new Superminds from being marked as expired.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should run without error.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

--->

### Summary

Boost feed pagination is broken.


### Steps to reproduce

Go https://www.minds.com/discovery/boost/feed

Try to scroll. Can't.

### Platform information 

Web, probably effects mobile too.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Pagination is broken.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- Pagination should work in the feed - note currently `has_more` is returning `null`.
- [TBC] Pagination should work when anywhere between 1 result and all results are stripped due to blocked users.
- [TBC] Same as above for banned users presuming we have migrated banned users from Vitess and stripped them from the feed.

## Goal

Increase the success rate of Boost submissions by preventing a Boost submission to an audience category for which that activity post was already rejected.

## What needs to be done

- Given a Boost is submitted to the `Safe` audience,
- and the Boost is rejected due to `Wrong audience`,
- when the user retries the Boost via the Boost console,
- then the `Controversial` audience is pre-selected,
- and the `Safe` audience selection is grayed out.

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Some vertical videos (9:16) are displayed in widescreen (16:9) video players.

### Steps to reproduce

I've had this occur multiple times, but not 100% on the repro steps. What I think can repro is...

- Launch the composer
- Upload the video
- **As soon as the video is uploaded and the `Post` button is active, click `Post` to create the post**
- Wait for the video to finish transcoding

(Waiting to click `Post` AFTER transcoding appears to avoid this bug.)

### Platform information 

MacOS + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The vertical video is displayed in a horizontal player.

[Example](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1469420770860994572)

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The vertical video is displayed in a vertical player.

Please read this!

The Definition of Ready (DoR) can be found at https://developers.minds.com/docs/handbook/how-we-work/#definition-of-ready-dor

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Increase engagement with PREMIUM content from Minds+ subscribers by making the posts more appealing / engaging to users without Minds+ subscriptions.

## What needs to be done

Design changes to paywalled activity posts to make them more engaging for users who do not have Minds+ subscriptions.

Some ideas...

- For media posts, expose all text content of the post
- Expose comments / replies to the post
- Expose familiar channel names of people who've upvoted the post
- Blur only half an image
- Unblur an image and then blur after 3 seconds on screen
- ...

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed

## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.

**Continue Reading Added: Similar use to 'See More' however in this case we use the primary color for the link to serve as a distinguishing factor between the two. Also, when 'Continue reading' is clicked it will open up the Minds+ Modal to subscribe to Minds+ just like the 'Unlock Post' button.**

![Continue_reading_added_up](/uploads/641ec8cb49ed2663a6d2da7f78fc1cea/Continue_reading_added_up.png)

**Addition of 'X' follows 'Y' reusing the remind location. In the case where a Minds+ post is reminded and has this already on the post, the remind would supersede and take priority as the main notice on the post. This is similar to the location we used when we implemented this for Superminds. Icon used in the design is the same as the current 'Groups' material icon**

**Control Group:** Keep the same blur amount/strength on Minds+ paywalled posts.

**Test Group:** Reduce blur amount/strength by 40% to help give the user more context to unlock the post and join Minds+ to see the full unblurred image. We will measure the unlock rate on reduced blurred vs full blurred images to see if a reduced blur leads to higher Minds+ sign-ups from 'Unlock Post'

- Log in with an account with no Boosts
- Navigate to the Boost console

### Platform information 

- iOS app
- Android app

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- A `Create a post` message + button appears

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- A `No boost` message appears

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

### Summary

I've made a few test Boosts in V3 on Staging. One Boost is not appearing in my Boost Console.

The Boost is of this activity: https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1458689744366997519

I targeted the `Controversial` audience, with a 1 token boost for 1 day.

Differences between this and Boosts that did show up in my Boosts Console:

- Different activities were Boosted
- This one targeted `Controversial` while others targeted `Safe`

### Steps to reproduce

- Boost this post: https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1458689744366997519
- Target the `Controversial` audience
- Boost for 1 token over 1 day

### Platform information 

- MacOS + Chrome

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- The Boost does not appear in the Boost Console

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- The Boost does appear in the Boost Console, in a `pending` state

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

## Goal

Increase efficiency for the Admin team inside of the new Boost queue.

## What needs to be done

- Given a Boost appears in the Admin queue,
- when an Admin either approves or rejects the Boost,
- then the Boost is visually removed from the Admin queue

Note that the goal here is Admin efficiency. The faster we can get adjudicated Boosts out of the queue, the faster they can get through it.

With this in mind, worth considering prioritizing removing an item visually quickly, without waiting for network / validation. On the rare occasion that network / validations occurs, it may be preferable to quickly dismiss that item and have it re-appear in the queue (flash), rather than keep the item in the queue for the duration of the network / validation request.

## Goal

- Inform current Boosters about the upcoming changes to Boost
- And that the switchover may impact the Boost they are about to create

## What needs to be done

Add some messaging to the current Boost modal that communicates that (a) things are changing soon, and that (b) their Boost delivery may different than expected because of it.

Link copy points to: https://www.minds.com/info/blog/bid-farewell-the-boost-backlog-1445548466339057665

Given we will likely have a sizable Boost backlog of v2 Boosts when we're ready to switch to v3, @benhayward.ben proposed migrating v2 Boosts to v3 system. The user impact is that their Boosts will effectively be moved to the bidding system, in which their view numbers are not guaranteed. Customers should be aware of this possibility with their newly-purchased v2 Boosts.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

## Goal

- As Minds, I want to know what is the engagement rate of Boosted posts in various positions in the app so that I can optimize the performance of Boosts.
- As a Boost user, I want to know what engagements on my post are attributable to a Boost, so that I can evaluate the ROI for Boosting.

## What needs to be done

Add context to engagement events (upvotes, downvotes, reminds, comments) that enables us to discern these engagements from organic appearances and Boosted appearances.

The 'view' event currently has support for supplying client_meta which includes the campaigns, medium etc. We should extend these to be sent along with actions such as upvotes etc. 

For snowplow we should consider introducing a new `context` that will store the above information. The new context should also be able to provide the context of the feed, such as recommendation slot.
