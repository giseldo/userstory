- [ ] Every time the user visits the Newsfeed, the in-feed channel recommendations component does not appear.
- [ ] If the user chooses to hide in-feed channel recommendations on the Newsfeed, this DOES NOT impact their appearance in other contexts such as when it appears after tapping the subscribe button.

This will not only reduce the upload time but also the transcoding time on the backend

https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit seems to be the best alternative for this.


## What needs to be done

 - Install https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit for both platforms
 - Implement video transcoding as a previous step of the upload
   - Transcode video to 1080p and only if the resolution is bigger than that

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->


## UX/Design
-


## Personas

This will improve the UX while submitting videos to the platform, reducing the time to upload the videos to the server

## Experiments

-


## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The videos must be transcoded to 1080p for videos with a higher resolution
- [ ] The videos must be uploaded if the resolution is lowe than 1080p

## Definition of Ready Checklist

- [ ] Definition Of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria

> 
> I don’t see the option to remove the filter though on my iPhone 12 Pro running 15.3.1. It’s more of an issue because the filter is static. I like the static results while focus is in the group but I’d like to suggest a ‘remove filter’ option in the search box once applied. Also if you leave the group the filter should be wiped. The user could click the box and the option would be the default. That way the results could stay static plus the option to change filter or remove filter would always be present while not requiring any additional screen real estate.

The issue is that we are not clearing the filter when leaving the screen. 

### Test considerations

 - Open a group and search for something
 - Go back and open a different group
 - The search field shouldn't be open and it should be empty

### Summary

When posting a video from the mobile app on a 5G connection, the upload never completes.

The app shows an animated loading indicator above the video in the post composer, and appears to indefinitely try to load the video. The upload never completes.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Either (a) the upload completes quickly, or (b) the loading indicator accurately reflects progress so that the user knows it's working. I can't tell if it's working and I'm too impatient, or if it just hangs.

This issue happens only when accessing the newsfeed after not having used in the app in some time.

* In this case, I viewed launched the app this morning, after not having used it in maybe 24 hrs.
* The stories are slow to load. Seeing pulsating circles for around 4-5 seconds
* After fetching has stopped, only the Minds account story is visible.
* If I then pull to fresh again, everything displays as usual.
* If I close the app, relaunch it afterwards, it functionals as normal. Seems to only happen after not having used the app in some time. Perhaps after cache has expired...

### Platform information

iPhone 7 / iOS 9

### App version

v3.4.0

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Long messages are not sent, and are lost unless you happen to select all and copy before trying to send.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Send a long message (a few paragraphs worth of text)
2. It should appear as if the message is sent.
3. Press the back button
4. Re-open the chat
5. Observe your message was not sent 

### Platform information

Replicated on Android but I'd imagine it would be universal.

### App version

v3.3.0

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Message appears to have sent until you leave and rejoin the chat.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The user should be made aware if the message is too long and it should not disappear from the input box after they are warned. Ideally there should be some indicator of how many characters over the limit they are so that they can make necessary amendments.

Implement the base typography component following the design guidelines #3608 

I'm splitting each of the base components creation into three parts.

#### Creation
Creation of the base component initial version following what was done and agreed on the Icon one. This is composed of structure, design and single use.

#### Spread
Spread it throughout the current UI in order to understand how it can be best adapted for using in the legacy application, adapting the props and exposing the necessary component wrappers.

#### Performance
Analyze the component's performance on the benchmarking tool to understand if any additional tweaks could be made to improve it's render/update phase either through memoization or exposing new wrappers.",4

When you capture a portrait video directly on the app, there are multiple issues.

1. Immediately after posting, the dimensions are wrong and the post says There was an error displaying the media. This is really bad UX and makes the user think something broke, as the video has an error message and does not play.

![IMG_7882](/uploads/6d6294ed10da1f202d64baddbee8baa6/IMG_7882.PNG)



2. After a few minutes, the error message goes away. However, the dimensions are still incorrect on the thumbnail, and when you play the video, it converts to portrait but is squashed into landscape dimensions.

2. cancel button should have more margin from the bottom of the screen
3. placeholders should show the same number of items as the initial count of the interactions. e.g. if there are 10 dislikes, only show 10 placeholders
4. modal content should be handled better. currently the modal opens and it's transparent, but in the next frame it will get a primary background

### Design assets and notes

- Click through: https://www.sketch.com/s/d8dc6725-6ebb-4dcf-a558-958b8107779e/a/YGLZqee/play
- Revise nav drawer. Inclusion of switch profile icon: https://www.sketch.com/s/d8dc6725-6ebb-4dcf-a558-958b8107779e/a/3OjO9GZ
- New switch channel screen: https://www.sketch.com/s/d8dc6725-6ebb-4dcf-a558-958b8107779e/a/7yJyvg2
- Switch channel action sheet (from ellipsis): https://www.sketch.com/s/d8dc6725-6ebb-4dcf-a558-958b8107779e/a/oYJMMPx

There will be dependancy to have a 'modalised' variation of the login and registration processes to allow the user to login/register without losing context. I will create a follow up task for login / registration and will reference here.

* Unseen notification count is to be displayed per channel
* Tapping on a channel will switch the user and navigate to the newsfeed of the respective channel. Would be good to throw a toast notification here. e.g. `Switched to @channelName`
* When tapping on the ellipsis icon, an action sheet is displayed. They may explicitly 'Switch channel' or 'Logout'. The switch channel menu option would not appear if the selected channel is active.
* Logging out from here would then bring the user to the next available channel. Where the user logs out of the the only available channel, the user would then be redirected to the home screen.

This user will have to be created by manually calling the create user endpoint, and then the users details can be assigned to global vars to be used in any needed tests. Doing this means that the _login_ action can then be adapted to skip any onboarding steps that are present, and as a result we could run the tests asynchronously.",5

74570514,2020-11-18 14:30:45.224,Mobile onboarding issues,"## Martin Issues

- [ ] Speak Your Mind is not correctly aligned in composer
- [ ] In hashtag selection step, unselected hashtags should be white not filled in
- [ ] Buttons should be different color when active / non-active so user knows they can click
- [ ] Top section of discovery does not load on first landing, loads slowly / secondary every other time you go there
- [ ] Update toaster text when onboarding is completed to say ""Setup complete. You are now ready to earn tokens!""

## Mark/Backend Issues

- [ ] Trigger welcome notifications when a new user signs up 
- [ ] Expand channel and group recommendation lists to display as many as we are able to
- [ ] Recommend channels who have received the highest engagement on content using the hashtags you save
- [ ] Recommend groups who have a keyword match to the hashtags you save
- [ ] Send notification when onboarding is completed and user earns first token
- [ ] Users who have already onboarded to rewards system should not receive onboarding
- [ ] Do not show Minds+ content in top section of regular discovery (blurred images)
- [ ] Horizontal recommendations to subscribe to channels in first section of newsfeed for new users


## Decisions
- [ ] What things are remaining for ""Improve your experience"" and how long will it take?
- [ ] If the continued onboard for mobile only has two steps, we should combine everything into the initial onboarding (michael's opinion)
- [ ] After completing ""Complete to earn tokens"" I am brought immediately to ""Improve your experience"" which seems odd (think martin added a delay)

## Completed

- [x] Require hashtag selection before landing on the app (it should then show as completed when you go into the earn tokens steps)
- [x] User should land on For You discovery page after hashtag selections. 
- [x] Add ""Start Earning Tokens"" button to the top of the For You discovery page and newsfeed 
- [x] After I subscribe to a group and channel under 'improve your experience' the bar will not go away on newsfeed
- [x] Change 'Welcome to planet minds' to just empty with 'Speak your mind...' 
- [x] Phone number verification input seems to have lots of spacing in it. Also, the 'confirm' button should be visible when the keyboard is active. Currently it's hidden behind the active keyboard. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2862)
- [x] Initial signup screen skewed
- [x] Newsfeed still says 'start earning tokens' after finishing the initial phase. Shouldnt it say improve your experience...
- [x] No channels show when tapping subscribe to a channel
- [x] Groups text is greyed out
- [x] Once initial onboarding is completed, and the user is returned to the newsfeed, a toast notification should be displayed for the user. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2861)
- [x] Reduce horizontal spacing between tags as to increase the numbers of tags per row. On my iPhone X, I'm averaging 2 per would. Would be ideal to get 3 per row. Also, please confirm the border radius and font weight of the tag text matches the designs. It currently looks a little off.
- [x] Did not receive tokens when completed set up
- [x] Group names not showing in groups list
- [x] Double blue sections are confusing, I would remove email section as it is within the other section
- [x] The uploaded avatar does not appear in the header (top-left)
- [x] The old verify email banner should be removed (see https://www.sketch.com/s/3e7a8f54-04a5-4374-8bda-9de901f2afb6/a/aOdaOp)
- [x] Upon completing 'complete to start earning tokens' return the user to the newsfeed.
- [x] The onboarding panels should be dismissible if the user doesn't wish to complete the steps. Notice the ellipsis top-right (https://www.sketch.com/s/3e7a8f54-04a5-4374-8bda-9de901f2afb6/a/ZzzQKv)
- [x] When selecting tags, the selected tags are affecting the presentation of the others tags. I'm observing weird jumps and re-ordering of the other tags.
- [x] Keyboard should be open by default on captcha (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2858)
- [x] Keyboard should be open by default on phone verification (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2858)
- [x] ""Make first post"" doesn't receive a strikethrough after posting
- [x] Stories should not be empty (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2831)
- [x] Avatar not appearing once uploaded (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2856)
- [x] Messenger landing page does not work (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2854)
- [x] Email confirmation bar should disappear automatically upon confirmation (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2850)
- [x] Unable to place cursor inbetween letters in display name on ""Setup channel"" (I wonder if we should just have it appear blank so they have to write it in fully. We need spaces in their names so search works) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/2859)
- [x] Cannot upload avatar, blue circle appears and the upload/ take a photo options don’t go away, avatar never loads
- [x] “Plus” icon in avatar upload button is not centered",2

### Platform information

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

When split screen mode is engaged, the login session is forcefully ended. Note that I was only able to achieve this when Minds was opened second in split screen mode. Never when opened first.

- [x] Only channels with 'unseen' content should have a yellow stroke. Where a user has seen all posts belonging to a channel, the yellow stroke should be removed, and the avatar moved towards the end of the list.
- [x] If I subscribe to a channel with stories, I can't see any corresponding content in the story component. Even when pulling to refresh, or pressing the home button. Ultimately I need to kill and relaunch the app to see any story content for the newly subscribed channel.
- [x] The user should be able to add text to a post. Currently this is not possible.
- [x] The trash can icon isn't required (see above) and can be removed
- [x] The `x` above should be replace with a `back arrow`
- [x] The send button top right should be visible, but disabled when an image/video is being uploaded. Currently it is invisible, then appears once the upload is complete.
- [x] Monetize shouldn't be an option for stories (please correct me if I'm wrong here @ottman @jotto141)
- [x] Schedule post shouldn't be an available option

For reference please see the original designs here -> https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/mZq7DV

- [x] The close button (x) is missing from the top-right of the comment area. (#2955)
- [x] The comment count is not displayed (to the right of comments) (#2954)
- [x] If the user chooses to close the comments pane by tapping on the outer area at the top of the screen, the elements underneath the overlay are 'tappable'. In this case, the comments pane should disappear only, any the underlying elements shold not be tappable. (#2962)
- [x] The tappable area on the comment ellipsis is quite small. Could this area be increased, as it takes me multiple attempts to action it.
- [x] When viewing the comment action sheet, the user should be able to exit the sheet simply by tapping the outer area. Currently the only exit option is to tap 'cancel'. (#2962)
- [x] Please reduce the line spacing ever so slightly between the channel name and time ago value in the comment. (d741d7062c4b568965c2f322454f5d95522795a8)
- [x] If in the event there are zero comments on a post, and the user taps the comment icon from within their feed, could we activate the keyboard and focus on the comment input? (dc7038082e8da0fb25682d13f8d26f42890fab34) 
- [x] On the comment input, the tappable area around the ellipsis is very small and should be increased so it is more accessible. (5198a5d4e2dbfed837e19177aa5f5b9d779df2e6)
- [x] Tapping the ellipsis within the comment inout, launches the media gallery. The intention was to also include 'Mark as explicit' which is currently omitted. Is it still important to include the explicit option when adding a comment @ottman @jotto141 (ref -> https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/1avzDp) (#2967)

Please see below a clarification of how these dates should be displayed across mobile and web.

Dates can be displayed in one of two contexts:

1. Feed view. Utilise time ago values in the following short format.

* `8s` = '8 seconds ago'
* `30m` = '30 mins ago'
* `22h` = '22 hours ago'
* `Jun 14` = 'Anything that 24 hours or older. Do not display the year, where it is the current year'
* `Dec 25 2020` = 'Date from the previous calendar year'

2. Post context: When displaying a post outside of a feed, the full date/time should be displayed.

* `Jan 14 2021 · 1:42 am` / `14 Jan 2021 · 17:01`.

(Ideally the date time should be localised accordingly). e.g. FR -> `le 5 avril · 17:01`, DE -> `15. Juni 2021 · 15:22` etc...

The included design cover light-mode. A single dark-mode screen may be found here: https://www.sketch.com/s/242fed11-027a-48de-b053-6d4cc89bed75/a/aYvzyZ

### Notes
* Comments should no longer be displayed in a nested fashion. Instead, each level of comments is displayed within its own screen. This approach is clearer, and gives ore screen real estate for comments and comment creation.
* The term 'comment' applies only to top-level comment items. Anything deeper should simply be referred to as a 'reply'.
* There are two new filter options related to comments. 'Top' and 'Latest'. Note that these filter options apply only to top-level comments, and not replies.
  * Top: This is the default selection, where comments with the most up-votes are displayed first.
  * Latest: Comments arranged from oldest to newest

### Summary

Some users are experiencing slowness on the tab bar. The culprit could be any of the following:

1. [we're detaching inactive tabs](https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/blob/9f72906d3a115e7109b2ab8bb0f1853dd78ff129/src/tabs/TabsScreen.tsx#L170)

3. The tab indicator animation (it's okay to remove this if we identified it as the cause)

### Steps to reproduce

on a low-end android device, try to switch tabs from a fresh app state

### Platform information 

both but mostly noticeable on android devices, especially low-end

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Improve usability of the supermind console by allowing the user to filter by type.

The console is currently split into `inbound` and `outbound`. However, within inbound for example, there is no easy way to discern between pending requests, from expired or delivered - consequently it could potentially become quite noisy.

## What needs to be done

Update the display of Supermind offers in the inbox and outbox to indicate their status

Statuses include:
- Pending
- Accepted
- Declined
- Expired
- Failed

With the new play store review process that may take a few days in some cases, we need to change the release flow on the CI

Currently, we are releasing the full version of the app on the web (custom auto-update) and after that submitting to the play store.

If we want a simultaneous release for iOS, play store, and web we need to send it to the stores first and await approval

I already changed the play store to manage the releases manually (Do not auto-release on approval)

## What needs to be done

- Move the play store to run before the web release
- Since the web release is generating the metadata, used by the play store release job, we need to replicate that into the play store

## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.
--->
* Users can create SuperMind requests via a number of entry points.
  * Via an activity post (in-feed or post entity)
  * Via a channel (by clicking `SuperMind` within the header)
  * Via the composer (when creating a post and toggling SuperMind)

**Create Request Flow from Composer**

* Regardless which entry point a user tags, the proceeding flow is the same. The workflow when creating a SuperMind request is outline within the following prototype and detailed below.
  * The compose will launch. The SuperMind badge will appear top-right. Note also the slight change in context of the composer toolbar.
    * Monetise has been removed
    * The post button has been replace with a continue button.
    * \[Confirm which options to be omitted from the ellipsis menu\]
  * When a user presses continued, they will be brought to the SuperMind screen. Here the user can confirm the targeted channel, define an offer amount and currency type.
    * A user can pay in either tokens or cash.
    * A user can only pay in cash where the producer has a bank account connected to their minds account.
    * Where the producer does not have a connected bank account, the consumer will not see a cash option
  * When a SuperMind request is made, there are a total of four response types. There are:
    * Any reply (Text)
    * Video Reply
    * Image Reply
    * Remind
  * It is assumed that Twitter integration will not be required for the first iteration.
  * Where a minimum offer value is present, a user can not submit a request where the minimum offer has not be satisfied.
  * Once the user presses ‘Send Request’ a notice will display informing them that the request has been sent and when to expect a reply.

**Create Request from Activity Post in Feed**

* A new `S` SuperMind icon is to appear within the activity post interactions, replacing tip. Tip is to be moved within the ellipsis menu.
* After clicking on the SuperMind prompt, the the composer will launch with the quoted post in-view.
* Additionally, we may want to draw attention to the `SuperMind` button within the activity post (feed).
  * Where a user interests with a post (i.e. up-vote) we could highlight the SuperMind button my means of a popover.
  * See proposed flow here -> **[Supermind Init via post - prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=303%3A9795&viewport=-9081%2C5560%2C1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=303%3A9795&show-proto-sidebar=1)**

**Via the Composer**

* Additionally users may create SuperMind requests from within the composer, without being referred from a post or from within the channel.
* Note the inclusion of the new `S` / SuperMind icon with the composer toolbar.
  * As the user types, if they enter a valid channel name, attention should be brought to the `S` icon with a tooltip.
  * Clicking the `S` will lunch the SuperMind screen, where they can define the target, currency type, bid etc.
  * Alternatively the user can simply open the SuperMind menu without necessarily specifying a channel name within the composer itself.
* See prototype here -> **[Supermind init via composer - prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/thrGepQAxmcMGB7MoEEckM/Supermind?page-id=287%3A5127&node-id=447%3A14608&viewport=-9081%2C5560%2C1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=447%3A14608&show-proto-sidebar=1)**

**Via the channel**

* Supermind CTA will only appear when viewing someone else's channel. See prototype below.

## Goal

Improve the startup speed and initial memory consumption by lazy loading screens.

The metro bundler has an `inline require` that lazy loads the modules and a babel plugin that transforms the imports into inline requires when possible. 
Seems like this babel module is not working or it is not transforming the imports for the screens.


## What needs to be done

Use inline requires for the screens

import PhoneValidationScreen from '../onboarding/v2/steps/PhoneValidationScreen';
<RootStackNav.Screen

   component={PhoneValidationScreen}

@Johnthetester and Chesscats reported display issues with images on the feed. It's not just constrained to landscape mode. There's portrait mode images that overrun the view port as well.

![IMG_0CA149FECD66-1](/uploads/d88238a80613a82207e1d77dee37d139/IMG_0CA149FECD66-1.jpeg)

This is, however, a hard problem.

If we scale portrait pictures down to fit in landscape, they will be very tiny and very narrow.

Same thing happens if we scale landscape photos down to fit on portrait, we will have a very tall viewport and a very thin and narrow image

Clipping and centering images so the post fits and so users can click through to see the whole thing might be the best way to solve this. But I'll defer to the @michaelfbradley @jotto141  and @ottman on how we want to address these layout issues.",1

Ideally, users should be able to do this mid video. If this is a longer-term fix, then perhaps just remove the ability to do so while capturing a video. However, it is much better and industry standard to have this capability for taking videos.

To replicate:
1. Open composer and switch to video

3. Press flip camera while recording

The first crash occurs due to fast swiping immediately after you create an account #2216 - it seems like we unnecessarily have screens swiping in and out. It should just load and have the first onboarding screen automatically up when a user first signs up. After that, every time they open the app it should just be on newsfeed or wherever they were last. 

The second crash occurs after you press Next after selecting hashtags (see video).

Latest mobile designs can be found here -> https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-registration/

### Notes
* A continually looping video will play in the background through these screens.
* When going from one screen to the next, the video state should persist (i.e. it does not restart)
* When navigating to any screen that contains inputs, the keyboard should activate automatically on the first input
* The registration page contains only a single password input field (previously two)
* The CAPTCHA input appears within a drawer that slides up (and not an overlay as it currently is)
* Currently there are lots of issues within registration when the keyboard is active. The inputs exceed the available space on the screen, and accessing inputs outside of the viewports proves to be quite awkward. The improved designs contained above reduces the likelihood of inputs appearing outside of the viewport, so hopefully this goes some way in improving the registration experience.
* When defining a password the following popover should appear. Only green ticks should appear as the various criteria are satisfied. The red crosses that are currently implemented, should not appear at all https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-registration/#artboard3

## Touchability

- small, borderless elements should have larger hitslops than their size
    - all icons on topbar
        - e.g. topbar back icon
        - e.g. channel top bar ellipsis icon
    - profile icon on main topbar
    - TBD
- elements with a clear border should have a native touchable feedback
    - listItems
        - settings
        - bottom sheets
    - drawer list items
    - settings list items
    - report list items
    - ChannelListItem and group list items
    - TBD
- optional: elements with touchable opacity should have a reduced active opacity
- newsfeed images could have a subtle native touchable feedback (like tw)

## Gestures

- screens should be dismissable from a swipe-in from left on iOS and Android
- portrait viewer should be dismissable with a swipe down from anywhere on the portrait mode

## Navigation and Transitions

- page transitions should have a card stack style like on iOS native, like twitter, and like Telegram
- pressing newsfeed should smooth scroll to top

## UI

- screen header consistency: currently some pages use native headers, and some js headers
    - decide between native or js navbars and apply to all pages",5

That's why I can't comment any further than this. Do we have a way to track the performance of specific features and measure their success? or IOW, how do we know whether a big feature, such as Stories, is being successful, to know whether to continue developing it or deprecate it?

### Minor UX change
- [ ] Tapping on the left side of the screen when a video is playing may restart the video
- [ ] Tap and hold may pause videos
- [ ] page indicator may be wider for the active page and fill up according to the video progress. Previous pages should be grayed. 
- [ ] when stories are active the device shouldn't go to sleep (or when videos are playing)
- [ ] share dialog opens too quick. it should open with the same speed as other dialogs
- [ ] stories loading placeholder doesn't start only after the newsfeed items have loaded. The loading should start at the same time as the newsfeed loading
- [ ] swiping guide is shown everytime after opening the app. It should be shown only once.
- [ ] swiping gesture on stories has to have a shorter activation gesture distance
- [ ] Deleting a story doesn't have a feedback and doesn't remove the story from the list until the list is manually refreshed
- [ ] Posting a new story/post will jump the feed scroll position to the second index (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3361)

### Major UX change

- [ ] Swiping up from a story may show the comments beneath the story and more details like date and views. Instead of having these indicators on the story itself
- [ ] Stories UI openning has to have an animation so users aren't confused about the navigation change
- [ ] Stories UI navbar could be simplified (not a fullwidth view)
- [ ] Stories UI should be dismissable with a downswipe
- [ ] Photo/Story preview after taking a photo is not good

<img src=""/uploads/e49acb728ffa6b49db7394a2a8012c90/image.png"" width=""120px"" />

90965878,2021-07-28 06:44:34.184,UX Review,"## This is WIP

These early issues are just a warm-up and include very small issues, proposed features, and many bugs. These are still very random but I'll reorganize them at a later time. The next step is to have a UX discussion and discuss higher level problems and ideas.

* note: I wanted to create issues for these but thought that would crowd the issues list. So I'll list them here first.
* note: Some of these things (which are the tip of the iceberg) may be considered nit-picky but an elegant UI is all about the details and to make something truly simple one has to do complex things
* note: In many of these cases the issue may become irrelevant because the parent of those issues may need to be changed.

---

- [x] Splash Screen: first impression matters. The splash screen can be enhanced in a way that the light bulb of the minds logo lights up the whole screen and disappears showing the app content. This also gives more identity to the app. This is just one idea for the splash on top of my head (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3402)
- [x] Stories: Tapping on the left side of the screen when a video is playing should restart the video (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Tap and hold should pause videos (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: page indicator should be wider for the active page and fill up according to the video progress. Previous pages should be greyed. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: when stories are active the device shouldn't go to sleep (or when videos are playing) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Swiping up from a story should show the comments beneath the story and more details like date and views. Instead of having these indicators on the story itself (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: double tapping a story could upvote it. Double tap has become a common gesture for approval (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: share dialog opens too quick. it should open with the same speed as other dialogs (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: stories loading placeholder doesn't start only after the newsfeed items have loaded. The loading should start at the same time as the newsfeed loading (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Stories UI openning has to have an animation so users aren't confused about the navigation change (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Stories UI navbar could be simplified (not a fullwidth view) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Stories UI should be dismissable with a downswipe (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: Photo/Story preview after taking a photo is not good (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)


<img src=""/uploads/e49acb728ffa6b49db7394a2a8012c90/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [x] Stories: swiping guide is shown everytime after opening the app. It should be shown only once. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Stories: swiping gesture on stories has to have a shorter activation gesture distance (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3403)
- [x] Dialogs: when dialogs open and dim the background, they should also dim the status bar (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3404)
- [ ] Profile Page: chat button takes a ridiculous amount of time to load 
- [x] Profile Page: chat button opens Minds Chat but doesn't open/create with prompt the direct message with that user (https://gitlab.com/minds/chat-android/-/issues/14)
- [x] Profile Page: the tip button/icon has a small touchable area. In general icons have to have a larger touchable area than their icon size. This issue is seen throughout the app. including the message icon in profile page, and show more in text contents. (takes some tries to tap correctly) (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3405)
- [x] Profile Page: ellipsis action dialog cancel button's bottom margin is too small 
- [x] Profile Page: Subscribers, subscriptions and views is not in the same line and looks lazy (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3406) 


<img src=""/uploads/2857bcdf814360e1dd50c7d549724649/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [ ] I think something has to be done about the icons near the profile. Currently they take too much space, reduce the simplicity of the app, are ambiguous for new users (I still don't understand the airplane icon, and actively thought for some time what the plus icon represented which now I know is minds plus. I'm sure this is common knowledge between old minds users though). I'm not saying they have to be removed but I'm also not crossing that possibility off.
- [x] Profile Page: Join button is confusing to me. I've so far seen subscribe, follow, and now I see join. I also can't make sense of ""join""ing for example Bill Ottman (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3406)
- [x] The Select Dialog is .... (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3407)


<img src=""/uploads/0cefa2d3c934b63144b1a54c4705cb7a/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [x] Join Dialog: When selecting USD, the SELECT CARD select box doesn't have horizontal margins
- [x] Join Dialog: Join membership button has to be full-width and centered. It could also be more attractive.
- [x] The dollar icon for tipping may need a redesign. I'm thinking tipping is about supporting rather than being about money (which a dollar sign is about). Also showing the tip button with the dollar sign on every post means the user will see the dollar sign a lot. And that unconsciously makes the user think this is all about money (or in other words emphasizes monetary thinking). which is not a helpful mindset for a social media IMO. Also if all posts have a page for themselves, isn't it possible to move the tip button inside the post rather than making it visible on every post? How frequent is tipping? (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3447)
- [x] Images: Pan to zoom is essential for any social media with pictures IMO. The view image button in the ellipsis is a hack. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3408)
- [x] Images: view image navbar background color is broken. I'm on dark mode on my phone. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3409)

<img src=""/uploads/b167952fb0715f239a11543958ebb33f/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [x] Navbar should hide when the user scrolls down and should appear when the user scrolls up (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3410)
- [x] Aren't material icons boring? anyone? I'm thinking about the possibility of doing a custom redesign of important icons (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3447)
- [ ] Is there a meaning behind the design of the compose button? I'm just curious
- [ ] OPINION: minds plus and minds pro are confusing in regard to branding. They even have the same background image.
- [ ] Newsfeed Activity: Ellipsis button and its actiondialog load very slowly
- [ ] Newsfeed Activity: name doesn't have touchable feedback
- [ ] Bonus:

![image](/uploads/f498b240c07ff09556162633c763c21d/image.png)
- [x] The importance of the buttons of like dislike comment etc. are too much for being seen numerous times in the feed. they are too bold. they have to be thinner, accessible, but not in the eye too much.
- [x] I tap on a newsfeed post and it opens the stories UI. This is very confusing navigation-wise. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3412)
- [x] In the Stories UI, I can see a touchable opacity feedback on texts, but there is no onPress action. And the whole text's opacity is reduced on tap which doesn't look very good.
- [ ] Story animation was laggy on my device. Not too much, but noticable.
- [x] OPINION: enlarged text when the text content is short is heterogenous with other newsfeed text material and is harder on the eye to read because of larger text (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3413)
- [x] Videos: there's a black flash before a video is played which is clunky. especially in Stories (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)
- [x] Videos: the device shouldn't go to sleep when videos are playing (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)
- [x] Videos: the playing video should stay floating around when navigating minds. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)
- [x] Videos: video may keep playing in the background when device is locked. this will make listening to long-form content (podcast, interview, event) far easier. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3449)
- [x] Minds Chat: splash screen has UI issues in dark mode (https://gitlab.com/minds/chat-android/-/issues/15)


<img src=""/uploads/436b14f8531d891490ad46c67f75b3e5/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [x] Camera/compose has to open with animation. It currently has a poor animation and slightly flashes the entire screen white before opening the camera/compose (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3454)
- [x] Capture button in camera is grey. It should be an active color like blue. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3454)
- [ ] Slide up animation after the app is opened is unnecessary
- [ ] I'm confused about the actions of follow and subscribe
- [ ] I can't select a portion of the text in posts. I can only copy the entire post. The touchable feedback is also unnecessary
- [x] Open a story/post -> tap on up-votes -> subscribe to someone -> the dialog is closed and weird things happen that I don't understand (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3455)
- [x] Open a story/post -> tap on up-votes -> unsubscribe from someone -> the dialog is black while the app theme is light (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3424)

<img src=""/uploads/db786f145e6b135188388d4850046e1e/image.png"" width=""300px"" />

- [x] Open a story/post -> tap on up-votes -> tap on a profile and go their profile page -> press home button and leave minds -> open minds again -> the upvotes dialog is opened on the profile page (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3456)
- [x] Scroll down on main feed -> while scrolling down press on home in tabbar -> the scroll position jumps but the scroll keeps going. What should happen? it should scroll to top with smooth animation and only then start reloading (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3457)
- [x] Phone number verification ""Send Verification Code"" button doesn't have any validation. u can press it while having the phone number field empty and it says verification code sent to +1. The button is also always grey which doesn't make sense. (https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/issues/3458)
- [ ] Phone number verification: resend code button doesn't tell me to e.g. wait 2 minutes to get another code. but it has a rate limit so I guess that's fine
- [ ] JUST WONDERING: Shouldn't the start earning tokens button have a better call to action? shouldn't it be dismissable?
- [x] Analytics: the tabs aren't scrollable

### Possible fixes

Our mobile team have changed nothing that should cause an effect like this - immediate suspicion was that it could be something to do with the older Android 6.0.0 OS but that doesn't seem to be affecting a Browserstack Galaxy S7 (Android 6) that I tested with.

### Structure
You can see attached the building blocks of a action sheet here. https://www.sketch.com/s/ed8346e7-232d-4278-9fdf-aefbb31c1f30/a/52AYxGx

### Animation
See example animation using the following framer URL -> https://framer.com/share/Mobile-Navigation-Minds-iOS--ogwGjNnMFrUaSpljQJ2A/q0H8kNRcv?editor=1

### Notes
We would in the future like to be able to use the action sheet concept to communicate important user messages. For example, notices such as 'Upgrade to Minds+', 'Setup your wallet' or 'Download chat'. See -> https://www.sketch.com/s/ed8346e7-232d-4278-9fdf-aefbb31c1f30/a/1KLGyQp - https://www.sketch.com/s/ed8346e7-232d-4278-9fdf-aefbb31c1f30/a/1KLGyQp - We're not in a position to implement this now, but is possibly worth considering at this point.

Once we're happy with the above proposition, I'll remove the WIP tag from this issue.

Keeping the Lifetime membership as the only option can easily send the message to a new iOS user that the only way for joining Minds+ would be by acquiring 2500 MINDS. Considering the ~10 to 1 revenue gap between iOS and Android users this could be an interesting opportunity to be explored.

- Gathering data on what has already been done - iOS review/guideline wise - and what's the mindset behind leaving just the lifetime option.
- Considering Apple's review guidelines using a copy on the lines of ""Learn more about how to unlock the powers of Minds+"" - with/without an action button linking to the browser - could be an alternate quick-change.

Further discussion regarding the use of Apple's IAP could be considered. If possible - mainly privacy wise - using a 3rd party service like [revenuecat](https://revenuecat.com) can be an option for accelerating the development process and quickly validate the use of Apple's subscription tied with Mind's payment services.

- [ ] Change `ActionSheetCustom` to the default `ActionSheet` from the same lib - which uses a native ui component - on all instances that it's being currently used.

* Evaluate the Android counterpart. Using the default one will render a really similar actionsheet to the one that's currently been customized.

Although the ActionSheet's gonna be replaced later, this is a lightweight quick-fix that impacts all listing cards extra actions.

Probably the easiest way of quick-fixing it would be avoiding the scroll-to-bottom behavior and inverting the comment list. The infinite loading more and the dismiss on scroll would become smaller issues then.

- [ ] When auto-scrolling to the bottom of the sheet the message composer isn't visible
- [ ] When the user does a hard scroll-up the whole sheet is dismissed
- [ ] There's no validation to avoid sending empty strings on the composer
- [ ] The composer itself is unaware of the safe area insets
- [ ] The scroll list is unaware of the safe area insets

### Summary

Reported by @ChrisDoogood

We need to match the front-end for web and not allow members to edit media attachments in posts.
This is because it causes major issues behind the scenes; one example problem is that on image change, all previous interaction is lost, presumably this happens for video also.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make a post with an image.
2. Comment on the post.
3. Edit the image.
4. Note your comment is gone.

### Platform information 

Reported iOS, replicated Android (S10) likely platform agnostic.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

User can edit their image post so there are many things that break when they do this.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Disable editing of already posted images and videos.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

### Summary

Reported by @ChrisDoogood 

Translate button missing for comments in app.

### Steps to reproduce

* When tapped the user may either, `Send to` or `Share` - Clicking `share` launches the existing native share drawer (currently access via the ellipsis - note the ellipsis share option should be removed).

* The user may search channels https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/g0ARq3g - the exact search logic is undefined, but we should be giving greater weight to channels we follow / follow us, channels with recent chat activity.
* The user may share only with one group/channel at a time. https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/DPdZYd4
* When an individual or group is not selected, the send button is disabled.
* Only when a single group or channel is selected does the send button become activated.
* When a channel / group is selected, a blue tick will confirm the selection https://www.sketch.com/s/68237c3e-39a3-484d-9dce-3e7bde06d600/a/DPdZYd4
* Tapping on an already selected channel/group will deselect it.
* Ideally the send action can be completed from within the main Minds App - although in all likelihood this may need to be done within the chat app.

Two small additions should be made to the above MR

- Make channel bio an observable, so when a bio is updated via channel settings, it's reflected immediately within with the about tab. Currently used has to navigate away, and then back to the about tab for the newly updated bio to be reflected.
- Make feed list an observable within a channel feed. After a new post is created from within a user's channel, it should appear immediately within the feed. i.e. the user should not need to pull to refresh to see their new post

I'll keep the above MR labeled as a WIP until the above two actions are completed.

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

### Summary

I've had a couple of users report this. For me, my password manager 1Password does not show up at all on the login form.
I suspect there may be issues with other managers too so I'd probably test some of the most common if possible (LastPass, Bitwarden).

Though my issue is login we should also double-check that registration picks up the password generators correctly.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open app from logged out state.
2. No password manager prompt appears.

### Platform information 

* **My device**: Galaxy S10, Android 11, App v4.9.1 
* **A member (\@devonmcpherson)** reports similar issues with an iPhone 12 Pro ios 14.4 

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

No password manager prompt appears.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Password manager prompts should appear on login and register.

--->

### Summary

When responding to a Supermind video reply on the mobile app, if you attempt to record the video directly from the Minds composer, it returns an error when you try to post the video.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Send a video reply supermind to a channel you own
2. Reply to the supermind offer on the mobile app
3. Capture a video directly using the recording tool in the composer
4. Try to post the reply and you get an error

### Platform information 

iOS.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

- GIVEN THAT I reply to a supermind offer
- AND I capture a video directly using the recording tool in the composer
- AND I try to post the reply
- THEN the video in the reply cannot be played

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- GIVEN THAT I reply to a supermind offer
- AND I capture a video directly using the recording tool in the composer
- AND I post the reply
- THEN the video in the reply should play correctly

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

![image](/uploads/df80ed44655ddf5256300b2434df2ab4/image.png)

### Possible fixes

- Given the experiment is off, I should see the normal composer without these features

- Given the experiment is on, I should NOT see the monetize option in the composer poster options
- **Debatable**: Given the experiment is on, I should NOT see the supermind icon in the composer bottom bar

111612602,2022-07-14 02:09:25.375,Allow decimal in subscriber counts,"### Summary

Currently, if you have 1100 subscribers, it will read 1k subscribers - I believe this happens until you reach 1500, which makes it read 2k (looking at existing examples).

It would be good if we could show this as 1.1k - at least in the lower thousands.

### Steps to reproduce

See a channel such as https://www.minds.com/bitman007
That has subscribers in the low thousands.

### Platform information 

Likely platform-agnostic, happening on the front-end.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

We don't provide much definition on how many subs a user has when they first enter the thousands.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Up for discussion. On the ""about"" page it shows the actual number - but on the user's channel, it doesn't. I personally think it should probably be to  1 decimal place - 1.1k / 1.2k up to 10000.

111246351,2022-07-06 10:37:17.188,Use Friendly Captcha to detect spam votes,"## Goal

This change is aimed at reducing the volume of spam votes on Minds.

## What needs to be done

Execute Friendly Captcha for all engagements that contribute to Engagement scores. (Currently, I think that's just upvotes.)

The Friendly Captcha should execute in the background, and not require the user to click anything to execute beyond the initial engagement click.

If a Friendly Captcha fails, display a toaster message to the user communicating that their engagement looks like spam.



- In order to implement this task it will be necessary to find a way to use the JS part of the friendly captcha and remove the need for the webview


## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->


## UX/Design

(Need to define what happens when Friendly Captcha fails. If we're discounting the engagement, we need some transparency for users who may be engaging legitimately but still triggering a captcha failure.)

## Personas

- Users who earn rewards: By discounting inauthentic engagements, engagement rewards for authentic users should increase
- Token manipulators: By discounting inauthentic engagements, manipulators will have fewer tools for gaming the engagement rewards.

## Experiments

I suggest rolling this out not as an A-B experiment, but in phases where we can understand the impact.

- Phase 1: Execute friendly captchas on all upvotes and log the results, without impacting engagement scores. Use captcha-failed events to analyze the effectiveness of the method on identifying inauthentic engagement, and 
- Phase 2: If we're satisfied with the effectiveness, begin discounting engagements that fail the Friendly Captcha. At this point, we need to transparently communicate to users when it's failed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Authentic engagements (upvotes) function as they do now -- there is no change to the user experience.
- [ ] Inauthentic engagements trigger a toaster message disclosing the captcha fail.
- [ ] Inauthentic engagements are otherwise still recorded.
- [ ] Visualise to users that their vote is in progress
- [ ] Still submit failed events
- [ ] Snowplow 'proof of work' context to be recorded. Success boolean.
- [ ] Add to elastic metrics (like user account quality score does)
- [ ] Add configuration variable to difficult ramp

109037372,2022-05-24 12:56:56.355,Mutual Channel Subscriptions [mobile],"## Goal

Give channels validation by surfacing any mutual subscriptions to the user. It is a reasonable to believe that users should be more likely to subscribe where their peers are already subscribers. 


## What needs to be done

- [x] Provide designs
- [x] Review designs
- [ ] Get agreement on the logic detailed within the acceptance criteria
- [ ] Run by one of the mobile devs to get any useful feedback


## QA

TBC


## UX/Design

- [Prototype Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/WMrvIQMlt2aiXcMsedfvGZ/Channel-%5BMobile%5D?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A1482&viewport=4810%2C973%2C1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1%3A1482)

- https://www.figma.com/file/WMrvIQMlt2aiXcMsedfvGZ/Channel-%5BMobile%5D?node-id=1%3A1482


## Personas

TBC


## Experiments

* Not sure if we need to run any experiments here @markryansallee - The basic hypothesis is that users will be more likely to subscribe to channels that their peers already to subscribe to. This is nonetheless a low-risk feature, so perhaps it would be best simply to gather metrics on subscriptions where there mutual subscriptions are displayed, and make the feature available to all. 


## Acceptance Criteria

* Displays only where there are one or more mutual subscriptions (a mutual subscription is where a channel is subscribed to by a channels that the current user subscribes to)
* Will not display when a user is viewing their own channel
* Will display whether a user is subscribed / not subscribed to the channel being viewed.
* A maximum of three avatars will display at any one time.
* Tapping anywhere on the component will launch a modal with all relevant channels.
* Copy: The area here is quite limited so we need to be selective with the language.
  * \[1 mutual subscription\] @channelA is subscribed
  * \[2 mutual subscriptions\] @channelA and @channelB are subscribed
  * \[3 mutual subscriptions\] @channelA, @channelB and 1 other is subscribed
  * \[4+ mutual subscriptions\] @channelA, @channelB and 2 others are subscribed etc.

## QA

<!---
Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->


## UX/Design

(Need to define which push notification fields are used, and how they're filled.)

## Personas

- Active, engaged Minds users
- Users who may have installed the app, but forgotten about it

## Experiments


This change should initially be deployed as an experiment, targeting 50% of apps users. We want to measure impact on:

- Sessions per user (per week)
- Engagements per user (per week)
- Content engagement rate (Tasman is building this metric)

Run first on just android device to compare against iOS. Will be monitored outside of Growthbook.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Everyone should be able to understand what is expected to be delivered
--->

- [ ] Given a user is logged into the app, once per day they receive a push notification that promotes an unseen top tweet from their Newsfeed
- [ ] The user can disable notifications like these via the Notifications settings screen in the app
- [ ] Spec tests
- [ ] Add to terraform module the cronjob

## Goal

Define the workflow and the required changes to provide a more streamlined development/release workflow for mobile.

 - Have an automatic build for the current dev branch for both platforms (Currently available for Android only)
 - Ideally, have one single development branch 
 - Ideally, move iOS CI to gitlab
 - Remove current detox e2e from circle CI
 - Add e2e to GitLab CI using the new implementation (Browserstack real devices)
 - It should include codepush patch release

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documented new workflow
- [ ] Create new tasks for required changes

### Summary

The upload (requests) are canceled when the app is moved to the background (iOS)

### Steps to reproduce

- Open the composer
- attach a large media
- move the app to the background before it finishes the upload

### Platform information 

iOS

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Network request failed

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should continue the upload in the background

108033306,2022-05-04 19:09:36.155,App stack re-renders while switching user causing some hooks to be fired,"

### Summary
The main screen of the app (AppStack) is rendered a few times while switching users.

This causes some hooks for example to be fired with the old and new user sessions in a very close window.

In order to prevent some weird race conditions, we should disable the app stack while switching users

### Steps to reproduce

Switch users
- Social compass hook is called with both users

### Platform information 
Both

### What is the current *bug* behavior?
- App stack re-renders while switching users

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

- App stack should render again when the switch finishes


### Possible fixes

make the AppStack return null while switching users",1

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

Some posts don't get deblurred on Android

### Steps to reproduce

- use android
- use the latest version (4.24.0)
- Make sure your latest feed contains an image post
- Notice that the blurhash of that image doesn't get removed
  - This issue may not necessarily have anything to do with the first post and other posts might be affected

### Platform information 

Android

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

I just described above

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Blurhash should only appear when the image hasn't been loaded yet. When the image loads it should get removed. And it shouldn't appear at all if the image was previously loaded.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

107954538,2022-05-03 19:23:06.202,Limit camera video resolition to 1080p,"

## Goal

Improve the upload speed and the backend transcode time by limiting the resolution of the in-app video capture to 1080p

This feature was implemented already in the transcoding MR https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/merge_requests/1740 that we will not use for the moment given that it increases the APK size by a 300% and in some devices the transcoding is too slow to provide an actual improvement.

## What needs to be done

Create a new MR only with the implementation for the camera resolution limitation https://gitlab.com/minds/mobile-native/-/merge_requests/1740

## QA



## UX/Design

None


## Personas

It will improve the UX when uploading videos recorded with the app given that the upload time will be reduced.

## Experiments

none


## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] It should record videos with a resolution of 1080p
- [ ] It should select the better video resolution in case 1080p is not available on the device

## Goal


The goal is to streamline the report modal by clarifying categories and removing duplicate and/or unused entries.

## What needs to be done

Report categories should be updated to reflect the chart in the following section. Below is a list of changes:

**Text-only changes**

1. Change 'pedophilia' to 'sexualization of minors'
2. Change 'Encourages or incites violence' to 'Incitement to violence'
3. Change 'Impersonates' to 'Impersonation'
4. Change 'Copyright' to 'Intellectual Property Violation'
5. Change 'Token manipulation' to 'Inauthentic engagement'
6. Change ""Sex trafficking"" to ""Trafficking""

**Removals**

Remove the following categories:

1. Trademark infringement (because it is merged with IP violation)
2. Incorrect use of hashtags (because it does nothing)

**Modifications**

Under 'Intellectual Property Violations' (formerly 'Copyright') we need to link to the Zendesk DMCA form instead of saying to email to copyright@minds.com.

## Goal

Enable marketers to measure the impact of posting on Minds / Boosting on Minds.

## What needs to be done

When an activity post contains a link with UTM parameters, and a link preview is added to the post, then the link preview should maintain the UTM parameters.

Currently, UTM parameters are preserved if the user clicks the URL address in the post, but not if the user clicks the link preview.

Example post: https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1467274467364311058

## Experiments

Create flag names `engine-2503-twitter-apis` - when this is OFF access to the Twitter API is OFF.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deprecate endpoints that integrate with Twitter API by using Feature flag middleware if they're V3 endpoints else add checks in the endpoints themselves or managers - decide on best strategy based on what presents - do a scan but I think this is the OAuth2 flow for Supermind and possible XPosting.
- [ ] Feat flag off other pathways to the API such as the runner, and possibly delegates on boost creation
- [ ] Update UI to put references including OAuth2 setup, Xposting setup and settings, Supermind checkbox etc behind the feat flag.

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues

--->

### Summary

The mandatory codepush now lets the user use the app and once the codepush is downloaded it will restart the app. This causes bad UX since the user could be writing a comment or posting something in the meanwhile. Ideally, we should either keep the user waiting on a splash screen, prevent the unexpected restart, or show a mandatory update prompt. Or a combination of these solutions

### Steps to reproduce

- do a mandatory codepush
- open the app
- notice that at some point the app will get restarted

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

New boost console is not showing the correct amount of tokens and is rounding off too much which is misleading.
Works as expected on web. 

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open app
2. create a boost
3. on boost page, check the tokens.
4. if you have 0.57 tokens they show up as 1 token which is misleading as user would want to use that token to boost.

Staging

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Rounding up 0.57 to 1 token is misleading as 1 token can do a boost and it will not work when user tries to boost. 

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Tokens should appear exactly as in wallet- on chain and off chain both

## Goal

- Inform current Boosters about the upcoming changes to Boost
- And that the switchover may impact the Boost they are about to create

## What needs to be done

Add some messaging to the current Boost modal that communicates that (a) things are changing soon, and that (b) their Boost delivery may different than expected because of it.

Link copy points to: https://www.minds.com/info/blog/bid-farewell-the-boost-backlog-1445548466339057665

Given we will likely have a sizable Boost backlog of v2 Boosts when we're ready to switch to v3, @benhayward.ben proposed migrating v2 Boosts to v3 system. The user impact is that their Boosts will effectively be moved to the bidding system, in which their view numbers are not guaranteed. Customers should be aware of this possibility with their newly-purchased v2 Boosts.

122293686,2023-01-23 11:06:06.840,Warning for Minds Plus content on iOS in need of design work,"<!---
Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

The warning on iOS for Plus seems off 

- The blur may not be using blurhash correctly
- The component displaying `minds+ is not available on this platform` looks out of place and difficult to read - on web these are usually centrally aligned.
- I have no idea what the unlock button does, if the post is not viewable on iOS.
 
One thing to note is this is multi-image.

### Steps to reproduce

Look at a plus post on iOS
- make sure the test account has no minds+ options enabled
- search for `JohnG76` and scroll on his feed
- reminded locked posts have the lock not centered.
- posts with `The media could not be loaded` ave the lock not centered.
- the activity is rendered correctly at the beginning and re-rendered wrong immediately.

### Platform information 

Mobile

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Visually unappealing

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should be designed and implemented accordingly.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

## Goal

- As a Boost user, I want to know what engagements on my post are attributable to a Boost, so that I can evaluate the ROI for Boosting.

## What needs to be done

Add context to engagement events (upvotes, downvotes, reminds, comments) that enables us to discern these engagements from organic appearances and Boosted appearances.

Possibly: Use existing Boost campaign `event_props`, `view_campaign`, and/or `view_medium` attributes.

Possibly need to add a context for boosts or just marked the events with is_a_boost flag.

## Goal

As a user responding to a Supermind, I want to know why Minds is requesting permission to post on my behalf and know that nothing is being posted just by connecting w/ Twitter oauth.

As a user responding to a Supermind, I want to visualize what will be posted to Twitter before agreeing to it.

## What needs to be done

Spec improvements to the UX of flows related to posting Superminds to Twitter to address the user stories above.

- Flow 1: Connecting to Twitter oauth before responding to a Supermind offer that requires Twitter repost. (Happens once for a user.)
- Flow 2: Reposting a Supermind respond to Twitter. (Can happen multiple times for a user.)

candidates are: useApiRequest, useApi, useApiCall.

the other point is whether useApiPost and useApiFetch should be merged. e.g. into something like useApi. 
i don't feel like they should because then we'd have a single fetch() method in the response store which doesn't make sense when we're posting something (naming-wise). but maybe we can do something about that. let's figure out",2

### Summary

Despite mobile's keyboard handling is sometimes a cumbersome task (Even more on React-Native)

In many parts of the app, we are applying a combination of a KeyboardSpacing component and changing the SoftInputMode for android.

We should check if we can safely move the SoftInputMode logic inside the KeyboardSpacing component itself. 

The KeyboardSpacer component was necessary due to some inconsistencies between platforms of the KeyboardAvodingView and an issue detecting correctly the height of the keyboard in some devices. (At that moment, it may be no longer the case)",5

3. Press ""Email""
4. Tap the input field
5. Press the backspace button until all characters are deleted

### Platform information

iOS 12.1 / iPhone SE

### App version

3.2.0

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Deleting all characters in email address listed on ""Change Email"" page in settings causes white screen with loading icon which spins forever. Also, holding down the backspace button causes the same issue once one character has been deleted.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

You should be able to delete all characters either by tapping or holding the backspace button so you can then start typing the new email address.

Metrics to watch 
- Number of subscribers per user 
- We hypothesized that since number of subscribers positively correlates to retention for the data we've seen, that if a user subscribes to a greater number of channels / is served more relevant content, they are more likely to retain and stay on the platform.
- 2-3 day retention (user signs up, uses Minds, closes app, rejoins, logs back in and uses within window)

- variant vs. control (existing design)

## Goal

Reduce impact of spam by hiding comments that are suspected of spam.

## What needs to be done

We can automatically identify that comments are spam with a high degree of accuracy, but still want human review before they're removed from the site. When a comment is automatically identified as spam -- but before human review -- we should hide the comments from view, and enable the community to show the comments and give feedback about whether or not the automatic spam detection was accurate.

Please read this!

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""T - Bug"" label and verify the issue you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

### Summary

(Summarize the bug encountered concisely)

If a user uses dark mode on mobile, and tries to access the referrals link, they can go to the current referrals page. However, the referral link text is currently invisible. (referral link text is same as background color.)

The problem manifest only when switching from one mode to another. The color of default text do not update correctly.


### Steps to reproduce

(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)

Step 1: On mobile app, switch to dark mode. 
Step 2: Go on sidebar navigation menu, and access settings page. 
Step 3: Go from the settings page to other -> click on referrals page.
Step 4: On referrals page, view referral links, and you will notice that the css-color of the link is not being changed between light and dark mode.

Note- sometimes this flips, so that light mode is legible, but dark mode is not. See below.

Old title: ~~IAP: Implement Android item payment for boost + dummy API call (optional iOS)~~

## Goal

Provide in-app purchase support to app.

<!---
Clearly outline the goal of the issue and why we are doing it
--->


## What needs to be done

~~- Implement Android item payment for Minds Plus~~
~~- Add relevant screens and hooks~~
~~- Add dummy API call for backend~~
~~- (optional) add iOS support~~

Impossible to have a decent technical solution. The current UI would generate 464 unique products with values from $1 to $9000 to be defined in Google Play In-App Purchases.

Repurposed to 
- keep the boost cash option behind a feature flag (default off) - `mob-4836-iap-no-cash`
- prepare an appeal to be sent to Google following their terms violation warning, arguing that there's no decent technical solution to implement boosts with IAP in absence of quantity thus requiring the implementation of at least 454 distinct products, and also the lack of prepaid product since we cannot bill the users after the service would be provided.

124830869,2023-03-06 23:54:11.058,Mob: Add context to previews of paywalled premium content,"<!---

Before opening a new issue, make sure to search for keywords in the issues
filtered by the ""Type::Feature"" label and verify the feature you're about to submit isn't a duplicate.
--->

## Goal

Increase engagement with PREMIUM content from Minds+ subscribers by making the posts more appealing / engaging to users without Minds+ subscriptions.

## What needs to be done

- Update the presentation of Minds+ paywalled content

Consideration is given to how the issue will be demoed and tested prior to being deployed
--->


## UX/Design

<!---
Sufficient wireframes have been presented and understood by the development team. Full mockups are not required and re-usable components are encouraged.
--->

At a high level, changes fall into three categories:

1. Expose text content for media-based posts
2. Add social proof context to paywalled posts (e.g. Bill follows Jack)
3. Reduce blur of images for image-based posts

#### 1.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lkwynaYCljUsoeFTqTNJJr/Minds%2B-Paywall?node-id=0%3A1&t=cgizQiiqxEyXdgPW-1)

**Continue Reading Added: Similar use to 'See More' however in this case we use the primary color for the link to serve as a distinguishing factor between the two. Also, when 'Continue reading' is clicked it will open up the Minds+ Modal to subscribe to Minds+ just like the 'Unlock Post' button.**

![1_Continue_reading_added_mob](/uploads/ebd92ad9c12d7fea587550729587bdeb/1_Continue_reading_added_mob.png)

#### 2.

**Addition of 'X' follows 'Y' reusing the remind location. In the case where a Minds+ post is reminded and has this already on the post, the remind would supersede and take priority as the main notice on the post. This is similar to the location we used when we implemented this for Superminds. Icon used in the design is the same as the current 'Groups' material icon**

**'X' and 'N others' follow 'Y' where N >= 2**

| Top Bar Text | Do I follow Mark? | Do I follow Emerson? | Do I follow Jack     |  Do I follow 'X others' | 
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Mark follows Emerson | Yes | No | N/A | N/A|
| Mark and Jack follow Emerson| Yes | No | Yes | N/A |
| Mark and 2 others follow Emerson | Yes| No | N/A | Yes |

#### 3.

Reduce blur amount/strength considerably to help give the user more context to unlock the post and join Minds+ to see the full unblurred image.

Equivalent to ~20px blur in CSS.

- To design a mobile version of the in-feed boost rotator, with a carousel / swipe interaction.

We will be increasing boost inventory space by placing boosted posts in between moments similar to how Instagram does sponsored posts in between stories. 

We will also be putting a 20-second timer on the duration of each moment from now on, both non-boosted and boosted moments. This timer will apply to a progress line above each moment. The normal transition between different user's moments will continue to be used.

- [x] get rid of Home text on top of newsfeed and put a minds icon (centered)

- [x] fix white lines between posts in dark mode should be way darker

- [x] should be able to access subscription lists directly from nav screen. Make the subscribers count on the main nav screen a link that will take them to the same page as if they went under their channel and clicked their subscriber list.

- [x] help and support and refer friends should not be on top of nav not. those should be in settings

- [x] wallet icon wrong

- [x] boost icon and wallet icon are backwards

- [x] ditch square green buttons they look out of place. All buttons should be replaced with blue text hyperlinks on light mode. Need to confirm the text button color for dark mode. Confirming with Michael

- [x] logout should only be in settings and should be at bottom of list

- [x] text cut off in push notifications settings on top

- [X] log only errors setting means nothing to anyone (this is getting fixed in the new designs and moved to a developer tools panel in the new settings, nothing to fix here)

- [x] remove the left handed mode activity entirely

- [x] dark mode switcher should really move to the main nav screen in the bottom (in the menu)

- [x] there's a gray background behind the filters on my channel in light mode that shouldn't be there

- [x] the lines between notifications in light mode are way too dark

- [x]  the gallery, photo and video buttons in soon to be legacy composer should not be gray background

- [x] the buttons in blocked channels have the same square button issue. the post button in the composer with the oval make more sense for now until we bring in the new designs everywhere

- [X] be able to swipe out of the nav screen and leave a bit of open space on the far right side. Moving this one to a separate card so we can setup nav properly

### Summary

Cannot load group description, there are also reports that links cannot be clicked in group descriptions.
I've included the groups description in this card as I suspect they're related; if it turns out not to be please split this into a new card.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Visit the Help and Support group
2. Try to see description
3. If you can see it, try to click link in description

### Platform information 

reported v3.10.1 iOS IPhone XL

replicated S10, Android 9.0. v3.12.0 

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Cannot load group description, there are also reports that links cannot be clicked in group descriptions.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Should load description, and links should be clickable, ideally warning users of navigation away from the app.

The autocomplete feature displays channels in the same dropdown region once you start typing based on the characters you are typing.

Currently the only memory that exists within the search dropdown is from full searches (meaning you actually pressed enter). This task calls for remembering BOTH full search queries and selected autocomplete suggestions.

## Overview

The portrait feed is being used as a means to encourage native content (video and images) via the mobile apps. In essence, this implementation is a ‘pseudo-stories implementation’.

Framer Prototype
https://framer.com/share/Portrait-Feed-9BQBZfHLa1fjnokJKiiV

Design Assets
[Spec Export - Sketch Measure 2.4](https://design.minds.com/hosted/mobile/michael/mobile%23-portrait-feed/#artboard1)

Some functionality may be open to change.

## Functionality
* If a user uploads a portrait image or video from the mobile app, it will feature in the portrait content feed, as well as the normal newsfeed.
* The user contributes via the normal composer.
* When a user views a portrait piece of content, it is marked as seen.
* Unseen content will be highlighted within the feed with a yellow stroke
* Portrait content is displayed within the same UI as the full screen swiper, with in the inclusion of a ‘stepper’ at the top of the image/video.
* Tapping on a channel within the feed will bring the user to the first unseen post belonging to that user.
* The user can access the next post by tapping on the right of the screen
* The user can access the previous post by tapping on the left of the screen.
* Posts are grouped by channel.
* Swiping from right - left will bring the user to the next channel (to the first unseen post).
* Swiping from left-right will bring the user to the previous channel
* Tapping the `+` icons the left of the channel icons will engage the composer
* Only content created within the last 48hrs will be displayed within the portrait content feed.
* When the composer is engaged, the gallery functionality should be removed. The text option from the bottom of the composer should also be removed.

95822963,2021-10-20 20:39:37.378,Improvement: Comments UX / A/B testing,"### Summary

This extends @manishoo comments on #3464.

Minds web version allows commenting from the feed view and they're visible by default on the detail view. On mobile there is a two step paced animation for getting into it. Fixing it can easily improve the network's overall mobile post interactions.

- [ ] Open the `BottomView` from the list on the Comment Action
- [ ] Show the top comments (if any) on the feed list
- [ ] Show the comment section on the detail screen with a fixed composer

### Reasoning

There are two different issues and test opportunities.
 - Currently there is friction for posting a comment
 - Comments are hidden on the post detail page
 - Showing a reduced version of 1/2 top comments on the list can improve the post interaction metrics by triggering new actions

Any friction created between the user interaction and its final action will reduce its usage, that is true for the feed list but also for the detail page with the hidden comments and absent fixed composer.

### A/B Testing

There are two opportunities for testing
- Commenting without a full navigation vs commenting with a full navigation
- Showing top comments on the feed vs not showing top comments on the feed

### Comparison

By comparing it with similar apps architecture it could go both ways. There is a higher tendency of opening the comment section without a full navigation on Android and on the detail screen on iOS. The only way for closing on it would be testing on Mind's user base. Facebook show comments on the feed mainly for groups while Instagram was recently testing a reduced version of it.

### Limitations

If this goes through Product, we still need to check if there are any service limitations for showing a top comment on the feed.",4
95818220,2021-10-20 18:50:52.538,Improvement: Deprecate excessive use of web-like in-app tooltips,"### Summary

There are a number of components using different types of tooltips throughout the app, none of which are ideal for mobile UX. We already have an optimal strategy for replacing them with the `BottomSheet` component, let's just apply that throughout.

- [ ] Remove all unnecessary tooltip libraries replacing them with the default `BottomSheet` component

#### Examples

<img src=""/uploads/8bcb00ea722d9d45105b790d3a277194/IMG_0027.jpg"" height=""100"" />

#### Reasoning

Apart from the problem of the tooltip not being a mobile usable pattern; the new approach using the `BottomSheet` opens the opportunity for conveying significantly more and more organized information about each one of the sections, which can be later updated accordingly.",3
95816161,2021-10-20 18:00:00.594,Improvement: Notification tab section purpose quick-fixes,"### Summary

On the Mobile's Notification screen there is an information gap on the purpose of each one of the sections. This needs to be addressed at least with a quick-fix as the action comes from the first navigation layer / BottomTabs and could influence on the initial onboarding process.

- [ ] Add a `label` to each `Icon` and/or a `Header4` to each section
- [ ] Add a section specific text for each of the `EmptyList` components
- [ ] Fix the placeholder loader misalignment

### The Problem

On Mind's web version there is a hover label for every section. On mobile there is no information for identifying the purpose of each one of the tabs.

<img src=""/uploads/7d8356ecfac2255ddc7fe13e6a8668f0/IMG_0015.jpg"" height=""100"" />

### The source

This comes in part as result of the fact that the current UI abdicates to use it's TopHeader for contextualizing each screen and will probably be addressed as the navigation/screen architecture itself gets reviewed.

### Proposed quick-fix

As a quick-fix we could add a `Body4` text to every icon label or a `Header3`/`Header4` title to the top of each one of the list messages.

### Placeholder misalignment

The animated placeholder should be aligned with the list. If not perfectly at least should match the avatar's position to avoid the visual UI flick.

95809363,2021-10-20 16:04:07.715,Improvement: Clearing search bar UX,"### Summary

The search bar currently doesn't have the clear action. As this is standard for any re-actionable input and the search bar is a common feature, this has an increased critical level. 

- [ ] Add the action reset `tiny` `close` `IconButton` to the search bar input
- [ ] On closing and re-opening the search view the search should not keep it's state
- [ ] Add the correct `returnKeyType` for the keyboard action
- [ ] Refactor the bar structure to avoid the double close icon proximity

#### On re-opening

The `user expectation` is for the search to have cleared after closing and re-opening the view.

#### The returnKeyType

The `user expectation` is for having an actionable key on it's keyboard whenever it uses an actionable text input.

<img src=""/uploads/aaf676d700d1da7703bebab3a53c97b5/keyboard.png"" height=""80"" />

#### Avoiding the double close icon

Twitter and Instagram does this by using the `Close` labeled button on the right side of the input. Facebook does it by adding the back button on the left side of the input giving up on the search icon.

95805624,2021-10-20 15:10:49.598,Improvement: Chat pre-installation bottom sheet,"### Summary

Not sure if this should be considered an improvement or a bug. The app can't have a button on it's main navigation bar that automatically sends the user away from the application on the first press without any context. This can affect onboarding by inadvertently bouncing the user away from the app.

### Comparison

Facebook covers this by:
- Showing directly a modal with the in-app download modal on iOS
- Showing an informative modal then opening the in-app download modal on Android

### Proposed fix

We can use the `BottomSheet` to inform the user about the existence of the separate Chat application with the download option on the main action button. If the user choose to download it we can open the in-app download modal or send the user directly to the store/url.

### Future proof

Even if there is a future decision of moving away the chat action from the bottom bar, this behavior is still valid.

### Development

If there are any extra complications on adding the in-app install modal. Just showing the information sheet should be enough. The BottomSheet should be shown if the user have never pressed the action or doesn't have the app installed.",4
95801876,2021-10-20 14:22:35.599,Improvement: Composer UX,"The composer is on the center stage of the content creation and there are a couple basic UX inconsistencies that together can increase it's easiness of use impacting on user retention and the content creation process itself.

- [x] Default to the Text composer when pressing on the BottomTab (+)
- [x] Default to the Camera composer when pressing on the Story (+) pressable circle
- [x] Remove the duality of the Photo/Video tabs by merging them into one
- [x] Use a darkened rounded frame on both dark and light themes
- [x] Show Post/Story independently from which action the user is coming from
- [x] Add a label text to the composer story button on the list for increased UI consistency
- [ ] Invert the position of the cog and submit actions
- [x] Change the ChevronBack icon with a back action to a unified close (X) one

> This was added as a single issue for it being linked together and having reduced implementation complexity.

**Reasonign**

##### Duality on the tabs Video/Photo

Since the introduction of the Story feature by Snapchat the common user expectation is to have the video activated by long shutter press. On the development side it unnecessarily increases the complexity of the composer navigation/structure and maintenance.

##### Darkened rounded frame

Immersiveness is on the core of the Story/Reels way of publishing/viewing content. The darkened frame increases it by giving focus to what's shown on the camera. Instagram/Facebook/Linkedin/TikTok apply the rounded corners on iOS and just TikTok on Android. We could maintain the rounded corners for throughout both for consistency.

<img src=""/uploads/782604e155d273fa3e07764689ec0afc/IMG_9996.PNG"" width=""260"" />

##### Show Post/Story independently from the action origin

Currently we're hiding the text option when coming from the story (+) itself. As this is not being done by other social platforms and it's an extra step for development/maintenance the behavior can be removed.

##### Label text to the composer story button

This one is for visual consistency and increased usability. Instagram is using `Your Story` as label, but also `Add Story`/`Create Story` can be considered. It's occuring a

<img src=""/uploads/b143af9ec167262d5b77e2db99577cc5/IMG_9994.jpg"" height=""100"" />

##### Unifying the close action

Independently of the OS being used, the user doesn't expect a back action for changing tabs. We can replace it with a single closing action that closes the component. Currently if you are on Text and hit back you would open the camera view.

##### Inverting settings and submit actions
This is mainly due for it being positioned closer to the user's finger while typing. It also could have an active color for increased visibility.",20
