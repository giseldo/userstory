Since we're in related area, it's also worth removing non-applicable reference to subscription when creating a new SaaS subscription.

`init_new_gitlab_subscription.js` and `new_gitlab_subscription_form.vue` might need some cleanup with the above changes to remove `subscription` usage.

A couple of things to make sure with the changes:

1. The default selected namespace when visiting the new SaaS subscription page should be the one in the params (this is broken currently since its looking for namespace on non-existent order for yet to be purchased subscription)
2. We're still able to preview transaction when selecting different namespaces with correct prices and purchasing new subscription still works as before",2
108983087,2022-05-23 14:33:45.721,CustomersDot <> GitLab.com Access Token Short Expiry,"## Summary

Unsure if this is a ""bug"" per se, and [from slack discussions](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1653039025967549), nothing on cdot code has changed recently.  But multiple support engineers have noticed this as seemingly different from how it worked until now.

Recently (within the last week as of 2022-05-23), Support team has noticed customer's cDot accounts no longer being linked to their GitLab.com users.  From admin point of view, ""GitLab Groups"" page shows `Customer has not linked their GitLab.com account.` even when the Customer record has a `uid` and `gitlab` provider.  This creates an extra challenge for us on the support side due to reduced visibility on customer's namespaces.

From a customer POV, My Account > Your GitLab.com account shows `No account linked.` _unless_ the view is loaded as a customer logging into cDot using their GitLab account.

In the history tab, very recent entries exist nullifying the access token.  For example, [my account on customers.staging](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin/customer/59644): 

> 2022-05-23 13:35 | khughes+test63@gitlab.com | update [updated_at = 2022-05-23 13:35:35 UTC, access_token = ] 

The Provider is (and has been) `gitlab` and UID is `1688436` ([my staging account](https://staging.gitlab.com/khughes))

The question here is: what changed and is it worth investigating?

It seems like nothing on cDot side has changed recently, so perhaps GitLab.com side?

### Support impact

There are a few services on cDot side which do rely on user-level access token when available, for example [Gitlab::HostedPlans::CreateTrialService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b3f20f2538d4da3bd016e19f86938e118f420f76/app/services/gitlab/hosted_plans/create_trial_service.rb#L115-121).  Support tooling [relies on that service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/console-training-wheels/-/blob/master/lib/support_team.rb#L143) for ""extending"" expired subscriptions; it doesn't currently supply an admin token so it fails to work otherwise.  Anecdotally speaking, this has worked fine up until very recently where we're now seeing accounts that had persisted access_tokens being invalidated.

### Customer impact

For the customer purchasing perspective, it contributes to a bit of a confusing process when managing an existing subscription.  Again, using my staging account (which was previously linked), trying to add minutes into an existing sub:

Sends me to the purchase URL (`https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92a0086a07f4a8016a2c0a1f7b4b4c&subscription_id=A-S00082613&transaction=ci_minutes`) now requiring an extra step to re-link: `https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/auth/gitlab?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fcustomers.staging.gitlab.com%2Fsubscriptions%2Fnew%3Fplan_id%3D2c92a0086a07f4a8016a2c0a1f7b4b4c%26subscription_id%3DA-S00082613%26transaction%3Dci_minutes`

which resulted in a 404

Refreshed the page landed me back at the purchase workflow

## Workarounds

* Have the customer re-link their account, possibly every few hours?
* Note for console users needing to workaround it: pass `is_admin=true` to [BaseTrialService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/cc75943924e1874a37640dca3929d2ca023d29c5/app/services/gitlab/base_trial_service.rb#L11)

108813978,2022-05-19 14:16:02.959,[BE] Emoji in Customer name causes errors interacting with Zuora,"### Problem

Customers are able to set emoji in their names in CustomersDot accounts. When we try to make a subscription purchase, we take the `bill_to_contact` details from the Customer record in the CustomersDot app. This results [in the following error from Zuora:](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/3267234/events/76539035/)

```ruby
Body: [{""Success""=>false, ""Errors""=>[{""Code""=>""UNKNOWN_ERROR"", ""Message""=>""Operation failed due to an unknown error.""}]}]

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new account on Gitlab
3. Navigate to CustomersDot and select `sign in with Gitlab`
4. Fill out the details to register for a customers dot account, and add an emoji to the first name
5. Create a group on GitLab and navigate to billing
6. Select a plan, fill out the details and submit the purchase
7. There is an `UNKNOWN_ERROR` message

#### Workaround

Once the emoji is removed from the name on the customers dot account, the purchase completes successfully.

### Proposal

1. Don't allow customers to create or edit their account to have emoji in their: `first_name, last_name, company`",3

### Problem

Similar to [other amendment actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4323#problem), we need a service to that creates an `orderActions` object when a [product in a subscription is updated](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription?_gl=1%2A1udimk6%2A_ga%2AMzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.%2A_ga_MY8CQ650DH%2AMTY1MjkxMjQ0OC41Ny4xLjE2NTI5MTM3NTAuMA..&_ga=2.124943242.1673435247.1652906974-397155918.1648069381).

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

n the module `app/services/order_actions`, create a service class `UpdateProduct`.

The service implements the following:

* inherits `OrderActions::BaseService`
* defines `#execute` method that accepts `params`

The `#execute` method constructs `orderAction` object to add a product to a subscription, with the below parameters:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `type` | String | Constant value: `UpdateProduct ` |
| `triggerDates` | Array of Objects | Each object has the keys: `name` and `triggerDate`. Defines `ContractEffective`, `ServiceActivation` and `CustomerAcceptance` dates |
|`updateProduct `|Object|Defines `ratePlanId ` and `chargeOverrides` (see example payload below)|

### Problem

CDot portal currently supports ability to renew a subscription using the [amendment api](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/68a37d0799e631fd9430ad07cebd620fdd97a271/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L156).

In the Orders API renewing a subscription can be done with `orderAction` of type `RenewSubscription`.

Similar to [other amendment actions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4323#problem), we need a service to that creates an `orderActions` object when a [subscription is being renewed](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Renew_a_Subscription?_ga=2.158945338.1673435247.1652906974-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1%2A1yg5lba%2A_ga%2AMzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.%2A_ga_MY8CQ650DH%2AMTY1MjkwNjk3Mi41Ni4xLjE2NTI5MDgyMDUuMA..).

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Order related services can be summarized in the following way:

![Orders_architecture](/uploads/1283f86682dff3e6aa5aff82959502de/Orders_architecture.jpg)

The renewal order action can be supported with the below steps:

- [ ] Create a `RenewSubscription` order action service in `app/services/zuora/orders/actions`. The service inherits `Zuora::Orders::Actions::BaseService`
- [ ] Implement `#execute` method. The `#execute` method returns the hash required by `RenewSubscription` orderAction (`type` and `triggerDates`)
- [ ] Since `CreateSubscription` service also implements `triggerDates` (see [source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/68a37d0799e631fd9430ad07cebd620fdd97a271/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/create_subscription.rb#L42)), we can create an entity for `TriggerDates` in `app/services/zuora/orders/entities`. Use this entity in `RenewSubscription` and refactor `CreateSubscription` to use it. Example of an entity: [`NewAccount`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/zuora/orders/entities/new_account.rb).


### References

`RenewSubscription` orderAction attributes:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `type` | String | Constant value: `RenewSubscription` |
| `triggerDates` | Array of Objects | Each object has the keys: `name` and `triggerDate`. Defines `ContractEffective`, `ServiceActivation` and `CustomerAcceptance` dates <br/>`ContractEffective`: $Subscription.term_end_date <br/>`ServiceActivation`: current_date <br/>`CustomerAcceptance`: Not present in existing payload. We can probably use current date.   <br/>Refer example below for object construction. |

    {
       ""name"": ""CustomerAcceptance"",

### Problem

CDot uses the Zuora's amend subscription API for at least the following use cases:

  - [remove a product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c5b1db13d4af8db292118c2227c696c1ee8f61c2/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L39) ([downgrade main product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L30))
  - [add a new product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c5b1db13d4af8db292118c2227c696c1ee8f61c2/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L45) ([upgrade main product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L30))
  - [renew subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c5b1db13d4af8db292118c2227c696c1ee8f61c2/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L139)
  - [apply true ups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c5b1db13d4af8db292118c2227c696c1ee8f61c2/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L32) (add a new product)

Although they are all amendment actions, in the Orders API each of it are **different** Order actions and their payload varies.

In this issue, we will focus on creating a service to [Add a Product to a subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Add_a_Product_to_a_Subscription?_ga=2.166350910.1673435247.1652906974-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1%2A5yur29%2A_ga%2AMzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.%2A_ga_MY8CQ650DH%2AMTY1MjkwNjk3Mi41Ni4xLjE2NTI5MDgyMjMuMA..).

The service implements the following:
  * inherits `Zuora::Orders::Actions::BaseService`
  * defines `.execute` method that accepts `params` and instantiates an object of the class and invoked `#execute`
  * defines `#execute` method

The `#execute` method constructs `orderAction` object to add a product to a subscription, with the below parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`type`|String|Constant value: `AddProduct`|
|`triggerDates`|Array of Objects| Each object has the keys: `name` and `triggerDate`. </br> Defines `ContractEffective`, `ServiceActivation` and `CustomerAcceptance` dates|
|`addProduct`|Object|Defines `productRatePlanId` and `chargeOverrides` (see example payload below)|

The params are set in accordance to the current logic for adding a new product in `AmendSubscriptionService`

108735850,2022-05-18 10:19:08.979,Allow validating older licenses in Admin,"### Problem

During a recent incident, a [license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/20343) that was created in 2017 was validated in `/admin/license/validate_license`. The validations for a license have changed over time and now require fields like expires at, zuora subscription id or zuora subscription name to be present. 

Since this wasn't the case when the mentioned license was created, the license can not be decrypted in `/admin/license/validate_license`.

### Proposal

Allow using `/admin/license/validate_license` with older licenses that aren't decrytable as of today because of validation changes. At the moment there are two display, a green alert for a successful validation and a red one for any issues with validating the license. Add a yellow alert for licenses that aren't considered valid anymore to differentiate between an actual valid license and a license that was once considered valid.

### Result

Ability to validate older license in `/admin/license/validate_license`.",1

### Problem

Once we have the elements to create an order, the next step is we use it to create a new subscription. This change should be feature flagged.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

When feature flag is turned on, use  [`OrderManagerService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4314) when creating a new subscription via the [`SubscriptionsController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/66c2b5da4aa5a9d338c3bd2bbe1cee96933772b9/app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb#L80) workflow.

Marketplace changes to be handled as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4526

:warning: Ensure the Subscription via Orders API workflow is enabled only when:

- Feature flag is enabled
- Not a marketplace request
- Not a preview

### Result

Orders API is used to create subscription.

### Problem

In CDot, Zuora actions are usually invoked as a [background job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/app/jobs/zuora/actions), as these actions make API calls to Zuora.

Once we have [Zuora::Order action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4286) created, we can similarly add a background job that invokes the order action. 

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create `Zuora::Actions::Order` job in `app/jobs/zuora/actions`. 

The `#perform` method has supports the following:

  - it accepts `params` argument. The argument supports keys that `IronBank::Actions::Order` accepts: `orderDate`, `existingAccountNumber`, `subscriptions` and `processingOptions`.
  - It invokes IronBank Order action `IronBank::Actions::Order.call(params)`
  - returns the result returned by IronBank Order action
  - handles appropriate exceptions

### Result

The `Zuora::Actions::Order` job is used to create orders in Zuora.

### Problem

The service module `Zuora::Orders` holds service class that generates `orderAction` object for each type ([create a subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4310), renewing a subscription, and so on).

The purpose of Order Manager Service is to construct the payload for [Create Orders API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.234436310.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1*9e5pc3*_ga*Mzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1MjI5OTkwOS41MC4xLjE2NTIzMDAyNzYuMA..#operation/POST_Order).

For the `orderActions` object, it can invoke the individual order action services.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create `OrderManagerService` service under `Zuora::Orders` module in `app/services`.

Define `#execute` method constructs the payload object with params to create a new subscription (in the scope of this issue):

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `orderDate` | String | Current date |
| `existingAccountNumber` | String | Account number |
| `subscriptions` | Array of objects | In the scope of this issue, invoke the [service to create a subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4310). It will return an `orderActions` object |
| `processingOptions` | Object | Define `run_billing`, `collect_payment`. Refer example below. |

### Problem

The [Create Order's API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.234436310.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1*9e5pc3*_ga*Mzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1MjI5OTkwOS41MC4xLjE2NTIzMDAyNzYuMA..#operation/POST_Order) supports multiple **Order operations** such as Creating a Subscription, Adding a product to a subscription, renewing a subscription and so on.

Each operation can be a separate service under module `Zuora::Orders`. The purpose of the base class is to contain shared logic of the operations. 

### Proposal

Create a module `Zuora::Orders` in `app/services`. The module will be used to hold all Order operations.

For the sake of this issue, we will focus on the order action to `Create a subscription`.

The Create Order's API has a `subscriptions` array that is responsible for determining all the actions that need to be performed in the Order.

The `subscriptions` array is a collection of `orderActions` objects. An `orderActions` object is an array of actions.

We need a dedicated service for each type of action that will be responsible for constructing an `orderActions` object  (e.g. a service each for `CreateSubscription`, `RenewSubscription`) .

In this issue, we create a service for `CreateSubscription` type and it is somewhat analogous to [`SubscribeService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f730068274d6d4a60615571539243c0c32bef935/app/services/subscribe_service.rb).

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create module `Zuora::Orders` in `app/services`. This module can be used to services for all Order operations. 

The purpose of each service is to process and return an `orderActions` object used in the [Create Order's API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.234436310.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1*9e5pc3*_ga*Mzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1MjI5OTkwOS41MC4xLjE2NTIzMDAyNzYuMA..#operation/POST_Order).

Create a service `CreateSubscription` in the `Zuora::Orders` module defined. The service implements the following:

  - create and inherit `Zuora::Orders::BaseService`. This base service may not have any utility as of now, but as we create other order action services, we can refactor common code to this base class.
  - defines `#execute` method that accepts `params`

The `#execute` method constructs `orderAction` object to create a new subscription, with the below parameters:

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`type`|String|Will always be `CreateSubscription`|
|`triggerDates`|Array of objects|Each object has 2 keys: `name` and `triggerDate`. Defines the following dates: <br/> [`ContractEffective`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f730068274d6d4a60615571539243c0c32bef935/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L162): current date <br/>  [`ServiceActivation`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f730068274d6d4a60615571539243c0c32bef935/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L163): current date <br/> `CustomerAcceptance`: Not present in existing payload.

108528662,2022-05-13 18:15:22.422,Determine Ramp Id for a Zuora Subscription,"### Background

In [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_913327995), we're discussing the best way to retrieve Ramp Id for a Subscription using the Zuora REST API.  We mainly need Ramp Id as a way to determine if a Subscription is ramp enabled.

As we've found out, Zuora doesn't make Ramp Id available in many of the Subscription-related API endpoints as mentioned in [the thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_913327995).  It's missing from the following endpoints notably:

> * `https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com/v1/describe/Subscription`: The [v1/describe/\*](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_Describe) endpoints are used to determine the schema for each Zuora resource. For Subscription, nothing related to ramps is included in the result.
> * `https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com/v1/object/subscription/8ad09fc280042bf401801a2c4b1538ec`: The [v1/object/subscription/id](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETSubscription) endpoint is used by CDot frequently to retrieve data for a particular subscription. It's a key endpoint utilized by the gem/library that CDot uses to interface with Zuora. No ramp information is returned in this API response either.
> * `https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com/v1/action/query`: The [v1/action/query](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTquery) endpoint is used by CDot when filtering is required (e.g. get a list of active subscriptions for a given account id). Constructing a query that references ramp id leads to an error so it seems like Ramp data is not available here either.

We've engaged with Zuora Support to see if they could add this data to these endpoints.  Zuora's response [as noted here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_941398840) was:

> We are planning to add Ramp ID to this GET Subscription API and are targeting sprint 34, which will be completed by May 20, 2022 and available in production approx 2 weeks after that : https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_SubscriptionsByKey
>
> Note that it is not the same API that was referenced earlier by Mark (GET Subscription API (https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETSubscription). We are not planning to enhance the Object_GETSubscription API. You can use GET Subscription by Key instead.

[My comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_941422221) shown below, speaks to why this might be problematic:

> This is a little disappointing. It's nice that ramp id will be added to https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_SubscriptionsByKey but that endpoint isn't supported by IronBank (the gem used by CDot). We could write custom code to use this endpoint to get ramp id but at that point it doesn't seem that much different from using https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_RampsBySubscriptionKey ([mentioned above](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_932690820)) which is already available for use.

In this issue, let's continue the thread [started here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968#note_913327995) and determine the best path forward to determining if a Subscription is ramp enabled.  I'm breaking this off into its own issue as it will focus the topic and also allow us to close https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968 as this issue is [no longer relevant](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7099#note_945251257).

### Proposal

Mark Q, Jessica, and I met on 2022-05-24 and agreed on a plan for determining ramp ID for a subscription. For this issue, we will pursue a short-term solution of using the https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_RampsBySubscriptionKey API endpoint to get the ramp ID for a subscription.  Long-term, this solution will be replaced with using the ramp id from https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETSubscription when Zuora updates this endpoint in late June.  We will open a new issue for the long-term solution.",3
108475574,2022-05-12 20:53:31.424,Rename external id and source fields from Order to Subscription,"### Problem

As [described here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4070#note_945175025), we need to modify the params and Zuora custom fields related to `External Order Id` and `External Order Source`.  It turns out an Order in Arrow is closer to what we know as a Subscription rather than Order.  This issue should cover updating the Marketplace API as well as the Ironbank schema files that reference these Zuora custom fields.

I've already engaged with Ent Apps about adding the new custom fields so that we can begin updating the IronBank schema files.

### Proposal

- [x] Update the IronBank schema files for sandbox and staging. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4769, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4781

   - Add fields `ExternalSubscriptionId__c` and `ExternalSubscriptionSource__c`
- [x] Update Marketplace API endpoint to reference new fields https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4782
- [x] Once schemas are updated, notify Ent Apps in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/628 that legacy custom fields can be removed from API Sandbox and Central Sandbox.

108454361,2022-05-12 14:51:49.712,Remove set_super_sonics_aware_field_before_license_notification once Orders API is in use,"### Problem

As described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4185, there was a race condition where license notification was delivered to customers before the super sonics aware flag could be set on `CloudActivation`.  This was addressed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4702 with some additional code [in `app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4702/diffs#bdf5b9dac21f5beca61699558db5ec40ffde85ab_164_162), `set_super_sonics_aware_field_before_license_notification`.

Something similar happened in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4513 after the release on 2022-07-07 of Strict Cloud License (SCL). When renewing and the SCL flags were not set yet, a race condition led to sending out the wrong email (unified email instead of cloud activation email). This was fixed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5053 with the same approach as above. To ensure this race condition isn't happening for subscriptions before the SCL release, the Super Sonics release date is used instead for the fix.

However, once CDot transitions to fully using the Orders API, we should no longer need these extra codes because all actions will be associated with one order which yields one subscription version, whereas the Amend API leading to multiple amendments and subscription versions.  The race condition should not be an issue under Orders.

### Proposal

Remove the additional code introduced in introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4702 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5053. In `app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb`, the methods [`set_super_sonics_aware_field_before_license_notification`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L179) and [`set_super_sonics_flags_before_license_notification`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L132) have to be removed. As well as the method [`renewed_after_super_sonics_released?`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/models/subscription.rb#L231) in the Subscription model.

This work cannot be done until CustomersDot transitions using Zuora Orders API ([epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6438)) which is currently being planned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4173.",1

### Problem
New GitLab logo was updated in CustomersDot portal in #4242. However we seemed to have missed to update the `app/views/devise/sessions/gitlab_login.haml` template. 

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create/find a user on GitLab that has not linked their account to customers-dot yet
1. Navigate to `<HOSTNAME>/subscriptions/community_program/new?edition=saas&product=oss`
1. Observe logo on the button `Continue with your GitLab.com account` to be old logo.

### Proposal
Update new logo in the above mentioned template. Also check if the logo update has been missed in any other place in CustomersDot.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
New logo should be visible in `app/views/devise/sessions/gitlab_login.haml` template.

### Problem

As part of the plan to [upgrade to Orders API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4173), we need a way for CDot to be able to create orders on Zuora.
The [recommended](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Migration_Guidance#Subscribe_and_Amend_REST_API_Migration) way to create orders is to invoke Zuora's [Create Order API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.234436310.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1*9e5pc3*_ga*Mzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1MjI5OTkwOS41MC4xLjE2NTIzMDAyNzYuMA..#operation/POST_Order).

The IronBank gem we use to interact with Zuora does [not](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/issues/80) support Order object and its related actions. Please however note [`Zuora::Order`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/lib/zuora/order.rb) IronBank resource already exist in CDot.

Although IronBank defines actions such as [Subscribe](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/5a6aae4bd75f74a0906b6256d0824c2e7412d282/lib/iron_bank/actions/subscribe.rb) and [Amend](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/5a6aae4bd75f74a0906b6256d0824c2e7412d282/lib/iron_bank/actions/amend.rb), `actions` are soon going to be deprecated. 

We should therefore avoid creating action classes. Some common behavior from [`IronBank::Actions`](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/5a6aae4bd75f74a0906b6256d0824c2e7412d282/lib/iron_bank/action.rb) base class can be re used.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create an client for Orders that implements `#create` method that accepts the parameters defined below, and creates an Order in Zuora.

[Create Order API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.234436310.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381&_gl=1*9e5pc3*_ga*Mzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1MjI5OTkwOS41MC4xLjE2NTIzMDAyNzYuMA..#operation/POST_Order) can be used for multitude of purposes such as creating a subscription, ramp deal, adding a product to a subscription, renewing and cancelling a subscription and so on.

Instead of supporting all use cases in the initial iteration, we can iterate over this and start with the bare minimum functionality to create a subscription.

[Creating a subscription through the Orders API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/AA_Create_a_Subscription?_gl=1%2A2t5uja%2A_ga%2AMzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.%2A_ga_MY8CQ650DH%2AMTY1MjMwODUyNC41MS4xLjE2NTIzMDg4NDIuMA..&_ga=2.200168166.991883880.1652218606-397155918.1648069381) requires **at least** the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
|`orderDate` (**Required**) | string <date> | The date when the order is signed. |
|`existingAccountNumber`| string | `accountNumber` |
|`subscriptions`| Array of object | Each item includes a set of order actions, which will be applied to the same base subscription |
|`processingOptions`| object (processingOptionsOrders) | Invoice or Payment |

### Technical Implementation

1. Create `client` module in `lib/zuora`

2. Implement Orders class in the `client` module. Create and inherit `IronBank::Client::Base` base class (incorporate common features from [`IronBank::Actions`](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/5a6aae4bd75f74a0906b6256d0824c2e7412d282/lib/iron_bank/action.rb) base class.

3. Define `#create` method. It should invoke the Orders API with parameters required to create a subscription: `{ orderDate: orderDate, existingAccountNumber: existingAccountNumber, subscriptions: subscriptions, processingOptions: processingOptions }`

4. Define a method for each of the parameter mentioned in the above pt; e.g. `subscriptions` should return `subscriptions` object `IronBank::Object.new(args.fetch(:subscribes)).deep_camelize`. Alternatively, consider implementing dynamic methods instead of defining one for each. Ref: [subscribe action](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/5a6aae4bd75f74a0906b6256d0824c2e7412d282/lib/iron_bank/actions/subscribe.rb)


### Result

`IronBank::Actions::Order.create(params)` successfully creates an order on Zuora.

## Summary

Changing namespace for a community subscription logs an error message `The coupon code '' was used to check out but it was unable to be marked redeemed`. This should only happen for new community program subscription and its renewal since we don't need coupon code for changing namespace or addon purchase.

[Sentry issue](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/3291044)

## Steps to reproduce

* Change the linked namespace for an existing community program subscription with more than 1 seat in use or purchase an addon
* Check logs locally / on Slack for Staging for the above mentioned error message

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

An attempt to mark an empty coupon code is made.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

We shouldn't mark coupon as redeemed when changing namespace.

<!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. -->

This issue is to rollout [Static Zuora component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4553) on CustomersDot production,
that is currently behind the [`zuora_hpm_no_refresh`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/126/edit) feature flag.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::purchase""

- Best individual to reach out to: @agulina or @lmeckley 
- PM: @tgolubeva 

## The Rollout Plan

- Partial Rollout with specific Customers on CustomersDot, [via Unleash](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#user-ids)
- Rollout on CustomersDot for a certain period (How long)
- Percentage Rollout on CustomersDot
- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can also be useful to review -->

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

The payment forms in CDot should use the new Zuora component but functionally behave the same as the old implementation in the happy path. The only difference is that errors will not cause the iframe to re-render.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

All CDot payment pages could be impacted and users could be preventing from making payments, renewing, etc. The iframe could also potentially not load. 

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? -->

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [ ] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [ ] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [ ] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [ ] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [ ] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [ ] Enable the feature globally on production environment 
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",2
110296543,2022-05-02 19:48:54.303,[SaaS] Add messaging about user overage process to Renewal flow,"## Problem to solve

SaaS customers are being surprised and taken off-guard by Quarterly Subscription reconciliations. Because self-service SaaS customers have not historically been charged true-ups, the QSR process and the fact that they have to pay for overages is totally new. See tickets from customers [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/337).

## Intended users

**This issue is just for SaaS customers.**

* Group Owners who are **renewing a subscription** through our self-service renewal flow
* See exactly which use cases we're solving for in the [Epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229#saas-customers).

## Proposal

When a user is **renewing** GitLab, make sure that they are aware of the overage process. Show a message to all customers using the self-service renewal flow that notifies them about the overage process.

A `Customer` object is required when instantiating a `Subscription` object ([see definition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/1d243289b208023d7437ce3d0fa363f8f38454b8/app/models/subscription.rb#L68)).  In most places as it relates the model, the `Customer` object is used as a way to reference the `zuora_account_id`.

When in maintenance mode, Sidekiq queues are still able to receive jobs. While this is unlikely to happen (as the CustomersDot app would not enqueue new jobs because of the maintenance mode), it would be still good practice to quiet all Sidekiq queues (except the `zuora_health_check` queue) upon having the maintenance mode on, and to have them to reaccept new jobs when the maintenance mode is off.

The `zuora_health_check` queue is the only queue not to quiet as it is tightly coupled to the app maintenance mode: it checks Zuora health periodically and gets the app into (or out of) maintenance mode depending on the Zuora health state.",2

107013125,2022-04-22 07:32:13.638,Remove subscription name field from manually creating licenses form,"### Problem

When manually creating licenses in the Admin area of CustomersDot, there are fields for the subscription name and ID. These fields are optional when creating a legacy license. Hence, the backend logic that checks if the subscription exists in Zuora works when both fields are field or when just one of them are filled. When only the subscription name is filled in, a wrong subscription version can be linked to the license. Whereas the filled in subscription ID will result in linking the correct subscription version is linked to the license.

Gathering some feedback from Support (see [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4601#note_919402242) and [this one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4601#note_920060764)) shows that they have access to SFDC and Zuora and therefore access to the subscription ID AND name. Given this information, asking both the subscription name and ID in the form is obsolete since the subscription ID will be sufficient.

### Proposal

Remove the subscription name field from the form when manually creating licenses. The information can be pulled from the subscription found with the ID and automatically set on license create.

109058282,2022-04-21 03:49:47.896,Up-to-the-minute license utilization data synced to Salesforce,"## Problem Statement
The current [License Utilization Salesforce app](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/license-usage-app/) is a WONDERFUL improvement as we had nothing before. However, there are a few problems with it:
1. Infrequently updated. Problem: not sufficient for quoting a customer, requiring another system for accurate, updated data
2. Monthly trend data. Problem: monthly is not frequent enough to build trendlines for Q2C processes
3. Lack of predictability. Problem: no guidance on where the customer may be at their next renewal (see trendlines above)

### Desired Outcome
A world where the sales rep can, in one system and one flow, review their list of accounts for upcoming renewals and customer check-ins to see license Utilization of their customer subscriptions for under, at, and over their purchased licenses to be better informed with how to serve them. Intentions include a better quote-to-cash process, license utilization visibility, and more efficient rep flow.

**User stories:**
1. As a rep I want to know how much to quote the customer for their current renewal. This may mean I need a trendline to forecast what their usage will be in 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 days. I want month-over-month trends.
   1. More especially for larger, slower entities
2. As a rep I want to see daily/weekly trends of my customers deployment of licenses (is it going up, down, flat? If so, by how much?)
3. As Fulfillment, I want an established SLA for how long it takes for the customer to send data to it appearing in Salesforce for reps
4. As an SA/TAM/SDR/renewal rep, I have visibility daily/weekly (i.e., Cloud License) license utilization data to track and support my customers and monitor how many licenses they've deployed
5. BONUS: As a rep and to support Q2C, I have visibility into how many licenses are deployed (utilization) and are active (users who have logged in recently). 
   1. We've included the number of _active_ users in the last 28 days so I can contrast and compare how many licenses have been deployed vs. are in active use.

### Problem

When [exporting schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#ironbank) from Zuora for a particular environment, the commands rely on the presence of zuora `client_id` and `client_secret` env variables in the [iron bank config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/config/initializers/iron_bank.rb#L9).

The [config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/config/initializers/iron_bank.rb#L9) however checks only for secrets.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Check for presence of zuora `client_id` and `client_secret` env variables in [iron bank config](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/config/initializers/iron_bank.rb#L9) before defaulting to secrets.

106538039,2022-04-12 15:53:57.421,Renewed subscriptions may not be receiving correct license notifications,"### Problem

As described in [this Slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01BPM66KNE/p1649771693748099), a customer with a recently renewed subscription did not receive the license notification with activation code as expected.  Instead, the customer received the legacy license email.  Here's the original question posed in Slack:

>  It seems that this customer received a legacy email for the activation, not the new SCL Iteration 2 email (with just a cloud license activation code, no legacy license). Do we know what triggered them to get that legacy email with only a license file, and not the cloud activation code? 

- [Zuora Customer Account](https://www.zuora.com/apps/CustomerAccount.do?method=view&id=2c92a0fe5b42d2b0015b5d5229a65433)
- [Zuora Subscription](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a128b5f7ffe331f0180182e91f02d66)

On Customer Account page, we can see 4 Zuora callouts sent at 04/11/2022 03:32:33 PDT relating to this renewal.

I found the following statements in the logs (adjusted to remove the customer name) which point to the problem:
```
2022-04-11T10:32:31.736Z pid=3957127 tid=2hvbv class=ZuoraCallbackWorker jid=3bf1bddc773b0f81e865d7ad INFO: {""message""=>""ZuoraCallbackWorker: Sending license notification"", ""subscription_name""=>""xxxx Renewal Opportunity 2019-04-12""}
2022-04-11T10:32:31.900Z pid=3957127 tid=2fvvz class=ZuoraCallbackWorker jid=3fc57f0fcc89c9432cee98ad INFO: {""message""=>""ZuoraCallbackWorker: Successfully updated the Super Sonics aware field during Subscription Renewal"", ""customer_id""=>3371, ""subscription_name""=>""xxxx Renewal Opportunity 2019-04-12"", ""cloud_activation_id""=>4038, ""super_sonics_aware""=>true}
```

It looks like the license notification is sent before we update the `super_sonics_aware` field on the `CloudActivation`.  If that’s the case, the legacy license email would be [sent here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d3def14bb4d349b9877a7e141cf347f10639a2ef/app/services/license_notification_service.rb#L32) because the super sonics aware field is not set.

The fix isn’t as simple as just reordering logic in CDot.  This is likely a race condition problem because the super sonics aware field is [updated when processing the renewal amendment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8993c11361f2fd925f28c1049f24ae55176d7a49/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L136) callout, whereas the license notification is sent when processing the last amendment callout (e.g. the callout for the “active” subscription) which in this case is [the RemoveProduct amendment](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Amendment.do?method=viewInfo&id=8a128b5f7ffe331f0180182e91772d0a).  It looks like the  super sonics aware field just happened to be updated a fraction of a second too late, after the license notification.

The good news is when we fully embrace Zuora Orders, this isn’t a possibility as we process one callout for all actions in an order so no race condition.  I think we may need to make one change in the callout code to ensure the SS aware field is updated earlier.

In the meantime, we need to rethink when the SS aware is set.  Right now we only set the field when processing the renewal amendment, but we need to  assume amendments won’t be processed in order.

### Proposal

CustomersDot could check if a subscription has been renewed since X date (pick a date from last fall) and update the `super_sonics_aware` field when processing any of the callouts (not just the renewal amendment [as is the case here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8993c11361f2fd925f28c1049f24ae55176d7a49/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L137)).  This way we can be sure that the `super_sonics_field` is up-to-date before delivering the license.",3

While checking the logs for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4154, we noticed that our [`Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/workers/salesforce/create_account_worker.rb) didn't retry the jobs that failed while production was using the outdated credentials.

We have error handling code in [`Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/46edc01d6ac41b279668c10a15f06a4aef6e5edc/app/workers/salesforce/create_account_worker.rb#L25-29) but because the error rescued by the worker (`Salesforce::AccountCreationError`) doesn't match any of the [rescuable codes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/46edc01d6ac41b279668c10a15f06a4aef6e5edc/lib/errors.rb#L43-50), then it isn't re-raised to be retried later. We only see the error logged and the job is 'done'.

Ideally, these jobs could have been retried by Sidekiq the same way we have retries on opportunity creation so the accounts could be created when the integration user's credentials were updated in production.

**Why does the [`CreateOpportunityWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c14f55f61a1b7e58962cd046378e3c4f2cb3638d/app/workers/salesforce/create_opportunity_worker.rb) retry these errors?**
 
When there is an error during the `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityObjectsService` execution (in this case the invalid grant) there is a `Salesforce::OpportunityNotCreated` error [raised](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c14f55f61a1b7e58962cd046378e3c4f2cb3638d/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L134). Since [`Errors.rescuable_classes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c14f55f61a1b7e58962cd046378e3c4f2cb3638d/lib/errors.rb#L59-61) contains `Salesforce::OpportunityNotCreated`, this error is seen as [retryable](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c14f55f61a1b7e58962cd046378e3c4f2cb3638d/app/workers/concerns/integration_worker.rb#L23).

On the other hand, the error raised by the `Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker` - [`Salesforce::AccountCreationError`](app/workers/salesforce/create_account_worker.rb) - is not seen as retryable.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Surface the errors rescued in services like [`CreateSalesforceAccountService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/46edc01d6ac41b279668c10a15f06a4aef6e5edc/app/services/create_salesforce_account_service.rb#L15) and [`CreateSalesforceAccountWithPlaceholderEmailService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/46edc01d6ac41b279668c10a15f06a4aef6e5edc/app/services/create_salesforce_account_with_placeholder_email_service.rb) through their response hash. 

If we send the error message of the error rescued along with `success: true|false` we could pass that information as the error message for the [`Salesforce::AccountCreationError`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/46edc01d6ac41b279668c10a15f06a4aef6e5edc/app/workers/salesforce/create_account_worker.rb#L48) in this example. This would give us more insight into the actual error that happened and also allow us to check that message against the list of rescuable codes. 

:pushpin: Even if we didn't want to retry `invalid_grant` issues, we could still use that information when encountering other rescuable  errors inside other services. With the current way we raise the `Salesforce::AccountCreationError` we don't pass any message so it really isn't matching the error codes anyway.

106020076,2022-04-04 09:57:08.608,Remove reconciliations feature flag,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4545#note_898092068, it came up that the [`reconciliations` feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/60/edit) is quite old and could probably be removed.

The feature flag has been enabled in production for a couple of months now (can't find a comment for a specific date). There are about 8 places in the code that are using the feature flag.

### Proposal

Remove the `reconciliations` feature flag and all related code places from the code. After removing it from the code, delete the feature flag config https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/60/edit.

### Result

Removing a feature flag and technical debt.

Once removed, we can update the feature flag cleanup epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8672.",2

# Bug

## Summary

Normally, only group Owner should be able to start a trial for a group. There's a loophole that allow users with `Maintainer` role to take out a trial for the group without having access to Group Billing page.

## Steps to reproduce

1. User A create a new group ABC
1. User A invite User B as a member of group ABC with `Maintainer` role

As User B

1. Signed into GitLab.com in the browser
1. Navigate to https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/
1. Click on the `Continue with SaaS` button
1. Fill in the form and click `Continue`
1. See the Ultimate trial provisioned for the group

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Users with Maintainer role can take out trial for a group.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Only group Owner should be able to take out trial. 

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,

This is a follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4120+ and is likely dependent on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4452+.

Currently, for some `Order` records, when we call `order.current_subscription` we get `nil` returned as the `account_id` is blank. 

Qingyu has already done an investigation of this here (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4120#note_889020095):

### Proposal

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4452+ is already being worked on to address this for reconciliation.

Once this is completed, we should be able to call `reconciliation.subscription` rather than [`order.current_subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3f4a30f72962aa0dbda3dd8f0eed05681262116d/app/services/reconciliations/send_seat_overage_notification_service.rb#L45) in the notification service and benefit from that work here too.",2

## Summary

When seat overage notification is triggered, a small number of these causes error because subscription cannot be found.

Taking subscription `A-S00010110` as an example, due to its `order.customer.zuora_account_id` being nil, the `order.current_subscription` will also return nil. This caused the exception. (p.s. `order.zuora_account_id` is present though).

We will need to investigate

1. if this is a purely random data integrity
1. if this can be recovered, or should be properly ignored

This is currently not severe, because mailing operation is new and is stopped half-way through, therefore no customer is being affected.",2
105445692,2022-03-24 17:29:22.458,Create CloudActivation record immediately as part of web direct purchase,"### Problem

An activation code for SM subscriptions are found in the `CloudActivation` model with a matching `subscription_name`.  These records much be created in order for the activation code to be shown in CustomersDot for a cloud licensing capable SM subscription.  

Currently, the `CloudActivation` record is created [when processing the Zuora callout](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/16e4f22fab6a4dfddfcff6f318241c2e67281b8d/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L24) after a purchase/update is processed in Zuora. We've found at times there is a noticeable delay between the time of purchase and the time the callout is processed.  This could be because of a delay in Zuora sending the callout or a delay in CustomersDot processing it.  

When this happens, the customer sees the license file as the only method for activating their subscription, until the callout can be processed.

### Proposal

It would be better to create the `CloudActivation` as part of the initial purchase in the `SubscriptionsController`, [similar to how an order is created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/343aa1c9ae880946b2aff53ed8c3a71628d0318a/app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb#L260).

### Problem

Current logic in [`Salesforce::CreateOpportunityService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb) creates the [`OpportunityContactRole` object](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb#L118) right after creating the opportunity. Additionally, when creating the `OpportunityContactRole`, a [new Contact is created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/contact_finding.rb#L14) if there isn't an existing one. This approach works for the most part but creates problems when an error is raised _**after**_ the opportunity is already created.

When there's an error during the creation of the `Contact` or `OpportunityContactRole`, the error is [rescued](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb#L26) and an unsuccessful response is returned to the `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityObjectsService`. This service then raises a [`Salesforce::OpportunityNotCreated`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L103) error and re-raises it so the job is retried. But since the creation of the opportunity is not failing, each retry of the job will then create **another opportunity**.

Another thing to note is that our opportunities are created in `Closed/Won` status [from the beginning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L98),  which doesn't allow us to find them in a subsequent retry because we expect to find an opportunity object with the same data (account_id, amount, type) **that is not Closed** in this [query](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb#L60-62). 

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

:pushpin: We should be able to retry the job **only** when the opportunity creation fails. 

Introduce a new `Salesforce::OpportunityContactRoleNotCreated` error and raise it if  [`Salesforce::CreateOpportunityService#create_opportunity_contact_role`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_service.rb#L134) fails. With this we can surface the actual object causing the error and have better visibility on the causes. Then, the error could be [rescued in `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityObjectsService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9ab555ef21be6742f2e58706db7037ee6e8dee52/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L63) and given it is not `Salesforce::OpportunityNotCreated`, no retry should happen. 

:pushpin: Other things to explore

- Could we create the opportunity in a non-closed stage so a retry we could find that opportunity and attempt to complete it? 
- Should we handle the `OpportunityContactRole` and `Contact` creation in a different service so the `CreateOpportunityService` only handles the creation of the opportunity?

### Proposal

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4079+, a new service was created that will create a customer (via `FindOrCreateCustomerService`) and a Zuora subscription (via `SubscriptionManagerService`).  These services must be customized to create these objects as desired for the E-Disty workflow.  For context, the `SubscriptionManagerService` is responsible for creating the SFDC account and other related objects [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/49d0aeae5ed9b8066078bc8ab2ae31fd629eefcf/app/services/subscription_manager_service.rb#L67) by using the `Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker`.

In this issue, the `Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker` and related classes, may need to be modified to support creating a customer from an E-Disty marketplace (Arrowsphere) order.  The existing classes were built with the web-direct scenario in mind, but these may need to be extended to support E-Disty marketplace.  

We are still working on the data mapping between Platypus payload and SFDC so the details of the changes to these classes isn't known just yet.  This mapping will be added to [the data mapping spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138UqGiYfGc8A4HyBin6JrsRelmjfGbqvg3UZ0nJaLTU/edit#gid=0).

##### Add (i.e. does not exist in current integration)
- `Opportunity.Fulfillment_Partner__c` and `zqu__Quote__c.Fulfillment_Partner__c`: These fields are not currently set for web direct, but is requested for E-Disty.  The value should be set as SFDC ID of the Reseller ($['tradingPartnerId'] in data mapping sheet.
- `Opportunity.Fulfillment_Distributor__c` and `zqu__Quote__c.Distributor__c`: These fields are not currently set for web direct, but is requested for E-Disty.  The value should be set as `~~a0u4M000006IZCl~~` which is the SFDC ID of the relevant Arrow account, who will be the distributor for all orders.
   - **2022.07.04 Update**: The ""standard Account"" should be used and not the Billing Account. So the value for `fulfillmentDistributor` should be `0014M00001pePen` for both Staging and Production

### Proposal

Build a new service that is responsible for:
- Creating a customer record, likely utilizing [the existing `FindOrCreateCustomerService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/0abb2c47962048af373ccec20cdf74b55252dce4/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L3)

This issue can focus on a simple approach where the service accepts a quantity, plan_id, and other parameters that are already supported by the underlying Customer and Subscription services.  This issue should not cover the customizations which will be necessary for the full E-Disty workflow.  We can look at [the `SubscriptionsController#create` action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/343aa1c9ae880946b2aff53ed8c3a71628d0318a/app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb#L80) for examples of the parameters that can be passed to the `SubscriptionManagerService` currently.  We should consider wrapping the elements of this new service into a transaction so that transactions can be atomic.

This service will eventually be called from the new API endpoint introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4078+.",3

### Proposal

Build the skeleton for the new, RESTful API endpoint that will eventually support creation of objects mentioned above.  This endpoint will be used by distribution e-marketplaces, the first example being Arrowsphere.  

We could build this new endpoint similar to existing controllers that use admin token authentication like [`Api::V1::LicensesController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/11fe580936f339405a14254ea1fd4131f3fb6561/app/controllers/api/v1/licenses_controller.rb#L6) and [`Api::CustomersController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/114b87e77e1529f7f6d25bea4b72096463e57f96/app/controllers/api/customers_controller.rb#L5).  Since this endpoint is intended to be consumed by e-marketplaces via Platypus, the controller could be named something like `Api::V1::Marketplace::SubscriptionsController` or `Api::V1::Platypus::SubscriptionsController`?

For this issue, we can focus on permitting the request params and returning an empty, successful response.",2
104573412,2022-03-10 19:47:23.893,Account in Orders Callout is the Invoice owner instead of the Subscription Owner,"### Problem

As [reported in the Orders UAT Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/554#note_867674777), a change was discovered in Zuora callout behavior when the Invoice Owner of a Subscription is different from the Subscription Owner.  Orders callouts are triggered from `Subscription.InvoiceOwnerId` rather than `Subscription.AccountId` as is today’s current state with the Subscribe/Amend API.  A [Zuora support ticket](https://support.zuora.com/hc/en-us/requests/346080) has been opened to understand if there are any solutions that Zuora can provide.

Zuora is looking into adding an additional callout parameter so that both InvoiceOwnerId and AccountId are included in Orders callouts but we don't know an ETA on that at this point.  In the meantime, we should explore other solutions on our side. UPDATE: Zuora has responded that this behavior is the desired behavior and don't intend to change it in this case.  We will need to update our callout code to accommodate this new behavior.

/cc @gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects

### Proposal

We understand that this behavior affects Orders callouts only.

This could be solved by adjusting [the `OrderProcessedWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/f9743a3e2eb5fbfe183daa15c76406dc28fbc23d/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb) to pull the actual `account_id` directly from the Zuora Subscription instead of relying on the params from the callout body.  There is already a natural spot for this operation in the worker, before the worker enqueues the `ZuoraCallbackWorker` for each subscription in the Order in [the `process_order_subscription` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/f9743a3e2eb5fbfe183daa15c76406dc28fbc23d/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L67). This method already [prepares the worker attributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/f9743a3e2eb5fbfe183daa15c76406dc28fbc23d/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L71) by including the `subscription_id`, `subscription_status`, and `amendment_types`.  This logic could be updated to also set the `account_id` using `zuora_subscription.account_id`.  This would ensure the correct account is passed to the worker that processes the subscription.

_Note:_ We should check if any other attributes are negatively affected by this behavior change (e.g. `account_name`).

### Previous Description
> #### Problem
> As suggested in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4372#note_865226482), it would be a good idea to move the logic block in `subscriptions/community_program/renew_subscription.html.haml` into a helper. With this we would get the additional advantage of being tested. The same helper could be used for `subscriptions/renew.html.haml`(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/views/subscriptions/renew.html.haml#L1-17) too as it has similar logic.

We can extend the wrapper to have `findByTestId` similar to how we do it in [`gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/frontend/__helpers__/vue_test_utils_helper.js), make `shallowMountExtended` and `mountExtended` helpers that use the `extendedWrapper`.

104266812,2022-03-07 08:21:12.659,Add presence validation for activated_at in SelfManagedInstanceActivation,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4418#note_862077160, a discussion about the possibility of the `activated_at` timestamp for `SelfManagedInstanceActivation` being `nil`. Looking at the current code, the value will always be present (code when [creating](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/dded5fcb0654a9af94b78c3153b4acadb1e5e60d/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L43) and [updating](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/dded5fcb0654a9af94b78c3153b4acadb1e5e60d/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L19) the `SelfManagedInstanceActivation`). Despite of that, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4418#note_863466271, the suggestion was made to add a presence validation for `activated_at`.

### Proposal

Add a presence validation for `activated_at` in the `SelfManagedInstanceActivation` model to ensure the field always has a value.

### Result

Additional safety to ensure the field will always have a value.

104265783,2022-03-07 08:02:14.230,Spike: Evaluate clearer error messages when activating cloud license,"### Problem

Errors occurring during activation of a cloud license are not clear enough what the reason for the error is. In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346461, a misleading message about a connectivity error showed up when trying to activate a cancelled subscription. The error was actually a no method error when the license was built (via the [SeatLinkCreateService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/7d14b53ed8df3fe8f996a992ca3e060f0bc8b430/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L181)) because the subscription couldn't be found. With the fix for this, the new error message will be the general ""an error occurred while activating your subscription"" error.

### Proposal

While [discussing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346461#note_863397425) the fix for the mentioned error with Support, it came up to improve the error reporting when activating a cloud license. Hence, this spike issue to take a closer look into how that might be possible. The errors will come from different code places (e.g. Zuora subscription, license creation, seat link creation, etc.) and have to be returned to the [ActivationService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/dded5fcb0654a9af94b78c3153b4acadb1e5e60d/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L25-28) and its [graphql mutation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/1b4516ee084d478c139cfd55bf3180ad9dc804dc/app/graphql/mutations/cloud_activations/activate.rb#L29).

103971182,2022-03-02 15:07:27.389,Add structured tracking events for sending of self-managed trial licenses,"## Problem

We do not currently have a structured tracking event available to understand when a trial license key has been sent to a user, which means we cannot understand the completion rates of the full end-to-end flow for self-managed trials. 

More information in this thread: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7612#note_852942467

## Proposal

1. Add a structured tracking event for when the trial license is sent. 
1. Consider adding a separate structured tracking event for when a non-trial license is sent (if it doesn't exist)  

> So we'd just need some way to know that the license key email was sent and to whom (hashed email perhaps?).

> I'm not sure how the standard paid license key email is generated and sent (or if it is still even an option as we transition to Cloud Licensing), but if it is then I'd suspect the code is in a similar area and could probably be instrumented as part of a pay flow instrumentation. (This again assumes that there are still self-managed license key emails being created and sent and not exclusively cloud licensing).

102805901,2022-02-21 15:07:28.891,The ActivateService sets activated_at timestamp even if activation fails,"### Problem

@vshumilo [identified here](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL7SX4N86/p1645454361851859?thread_ts=1645430143.560179&cid=CL7SX4N86) the `CloudActivations::ActivateService` still sets the `activated_at` timestamp even if the service ultimately fails which leads to misleading data.  The activation in this case ([Sentry error](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/3201934/?referrer=slack)) failed because the `current_subscription` was not found for the `cloud_activation` record ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/dded5fcb0654a9af94b78c3153b4acadb1e5e60d/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L51)).  This was likely because the customer was attempting to activate a future-effective subscription that had no current term.  This specific case should be addressed by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3980, however this is just an illustration for how an error in activation still leads to incorrectly marking the instance as being activation in the CustomersDot database.

This is likely not a big concern, at least right now, but it's also not great that the instance is marked as activated in the CustomersDot DB when the activation failed.  It's not a big impact because this value will get updated when they activate again later, but it would be better to have valid data.

### Proposal

The `CloudActivations::ActivateService` should probably be wrapped in a transaction to rollback changes if a failure occurs in the service.  This would mean the `activated_at` timestamp would not be saved if the activation failed for any reason.",3

On SM renewal page the customer is asked to enter the ""Active users"" and also the True-up value for the old subscription. We are using the [purchase_subscription_details.vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/purchase_subscription_details.vue) to display the Active users and also the True-up information on the frontend. 

Due to the validation to not allow users to enter value less than 0 during the purchase/renewal of users the same validation also got invoked for True-up box. See the screenshot below. This does not allow the users to renew the subscription with 0 true up quantity. The True-up count box becomes red and an error is seen below it ""Users over license quantity is not a valid number""

## Steps to reproduce

1. Go to renew page of a SM subscription.
1. Update the trueup value to greater than 0
1. Now set the trueup value to 0
1. Error - ""Users over license quantity is not a valid number"" is displayed under the box

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Validation error - ""Users over license quantity is not a valid number"" is displayed under the true up box if value is updated to 0

It should allow customer to set value to 0

If the reconciliation max users count value reported is less than the subscriptions total quantity then during renewal the trueup value is shown to be negative. 

On [renewal page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/app/views/subscriptions/renew.html.haml) we do the following calculations

```ruby
user_count = reconciliation_active ? @subscription.latest_reconciliation&.user_count : @subscription.user_count
current_user_count = user_count || product.quantity
users_over_license = current_user_count - product.quantity
```

If the active users count of an SM license has always been less than the license subscriptions quantity then `users_over_license` is set as negative. 

EX :- A subscription was brought for 10 users

* SeatLinkData with 8 users were reported anytime during the whole year
* then user_count = 8
* current_user_count = 8
* users_over_license = 8 - 10 = -2

The users_over_license is used to setup the trueup quantity on the renew page. 

As seen in the screenshot below the trueup value is set as -2 

## Steps to reproduce

1. Buy a license with 10 users starting last year.
1. Create a reconciliation entry for the order with user_count as 8
1. Go to Manage Subscription and then press Renew for the subscription
1. The renew page will show the trueup value as -2

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

The trueup value shown is -2

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The trueup value should be shown as 0

Right now we install yarn via `asdf-yarn` plugin but:

- this method is deprecated for Yarn 2/3. In order to make our transition to Yarn 2/2 more smooth we should migrate away from installing Yarn directly with `asdf` and reply on NPM.
- make impossible to install default global NPM packages with `.default-npm-packages`.

102641733,2022-02-17 19:15:20.763,Support Amendment and Order callouts,"### Problem

Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3926 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/579 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/590

With Orders Harmonization, both the Subscribe and Amend API (used by CDot) and the Orders API (utilized by Zuora CPQ and the Zuora UI) can be utilized concurrently. Previous to this latest release, however, both order and amendment notifications were triggered for any subscription creation or amendment created through the Subscribe and Amend APIs. As a result, as part of the Orders Harmonization project, we refactored CustomersDot to continue to utilize the Subscribe and Amend API when creating or modifying subscriptions, but to only receive an `Order Processed` callout. Once the `Order Processed` callout was received by CDot, we were able to query for the Order Details, such as Order Actions and associated Rate Plans / Rate Plan Charges.

With this release, Zuora has changed the default behavior, which is intended to prevent duplicate (Amend and Order) notifications from firing:

> We have now changed the default notification behavior in the tenants with Orders Harmonization enabled to the following:
>
> Only amendment notifications are triggered for amendments that are created through the Subscribe and Amend APIs. Only order notifications are triggered for order actions that are created through the “Create an order” operation. As of Zuora Release 2022.01.R3, any new customers onboard on Orders Harmonization will have the new default notification behavior in their tenants.

### Proposal

Rather than downgrading Zuora to get back to the previous callout behavior, we want to update CDot to accommodate the new behavior.  To do this, we must enable both Amendment and Order Notifications. This would allow CustomersDot to continue to utilize the Subscribe and Amend API when creating or amending subscriptions. 

The `ZuoraCalloutWorker` has [logic that was created to prevent processing duplicate callouts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/1ea64ad9fda6231056b46518c5d3ef3393157295/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L54).  We should remove this logic as now we shouldn't have to worry about duplicates (in Zuora Central Sandbox).  

**Notes** 
- @jesssalcido is enabling the amendment callouts in Zuora Central Sandbox now.
- We should upgrade Zuora API Sandbox to the same release version as Central Sandbox to avoid duplicates in this environment.  I think we can live with this discrepancy in development until this environment is updated.  @jesssalcido is working with Zuora now to get this upgraded.
- Until this issue is address, deploys to [CDot production will continue to be blocked](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3995) as this flow needs to be fixed for QA pipelines to pass.

We should send an email to **all group Owners** (not just the group Owner who purchased the subscription), because all group Owners should be aware of the overage behaviour.

As part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229, we will be sending few mails 1 day after a subscription has been purchased or renewed.

Currently, we [have a method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/app/models/customer.rb#L89) within the customers model which fetches all the customers based on `zuora_account_id`. The method is a [instance method](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/karl/3200/fall15/Notes/Java/Class/method.html). 

We need a method which when called with parameter `zuora_account_id` and returns all customers matching the same `zuora_account_id`.

# Bug

## Summary

Renewing and cancelling from Customers Portal home page doesn't resume / cancel a subscription.

**Cause**: [`SubscriptionCards`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/3855-unify-root-and-subscription-pages/app/assets/javascripts/dispatcher.js#L13) which makes the call to update the subscription is only executed for `/subscriptions` and `/subscriptions/<subscription-id>` pages but not from home page.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Visit Customers Portal with an account that has subscriptions
1. Click on `Resume subscription` or `Cancel subscription` for a subscription

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

The subscription is not resumed / cancelled and no corresponding API calls.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The subscription should be resumed / cancelled as per the customers action.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

## Workarounds

Customer can still resume or cancel a subscription by going into `/subscriptions` page.

101905622,2022-02-04 16:22:15.133,[SM] Provision Ramped subscription (automated),"# Feature Request

## Summary
The rollout of Zuora Ramps (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/-/epics/85+) will result in a change to the current structure of a ramp deal. Instead of creating a separate opportunity, quote and subscription for each ramp interval, a single subscription will now include all intervals over multiple years. For MVC launch of Ramps, provisioning of each year (after the first) will be manual. 

However, given the ease of use of Zuora Ramps, there is expected to be a significant increase in the number of Ramp deals in FY23, will result in a burden on the Support team manually issuing licenses. This issue addresses the need to automate licensing for Self-Managed Ramp subscriptions.

Discovery work being completed in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754) informed what data is received from a Zuora Ramp deal by CustomersDot which is required to know how provisioning could handled for each ramp interval. You can find the results of a 3 year Ramp test for SM [here in the issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754#note_807607785). As you can see, the resulting license was generated for the correct initial time period (the 1st year of the ramp), but the quantity was incorrect. The quantity was for the active/final ramp of the subscription (e.g. 30) instead of the initial ramp (e.g. 10).

### Problem Statement
Only one callout goes out for the new subscription, and includes all of the subscription / ramp terms. The license is created for only 1 year. There are no callouts for successive intervals.


## Proposal
### Start of Subscription
* At the current state, provisioning works partially for the first ramp year of a subscription.  Provisioning will be adjusted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3968+ to address the problems with determining quantity and end date correctly.  We will assume this work is completed before starting this issue.

### Successive Subscription Intervals
* Update the user's subscription license count to the correct value at the beginning of each ramp period
  * This will require a custom workflow in Zuora that will send a callout to CustomersDot to update the subscription's license in subsequent years when the ramp interval changes as this does not currently exist. EntApps work issue here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/698
    * The decision on whether a custom workflow callout can be used for this purpose was discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/145.  It was decided we will use a Zuora custom workflow for this trigger.


### License End Date Logic Update
Our logic for determining license end date ([defined here in CDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/3e8889422f9bc05f57cb205fb025364b28ccdcef/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L7)) is conditional. The license end date is set using subscription term end date if the subscription is a monthly sub OR is cloud licensing enabled (`TurnOnCloudLicensing__c` is `Yes` or `Offline`) and reconciliations are enabled (`TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` is `Yes`). Otherwise, the license end date will be set to term start date + 1 year.

Based on the default [defined in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/527#super-sonics-fields-and-standard-exemptions), it looks like ramps subscriptions will not have `TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` enabled, so the license start date will fallback to term start date + 1 year. 

**Requirement:** Add another condition to check if cloud licensing is enabled and subscription is ramp enabled, then use term end date. The logic might look like the below:

```ruby
    if monthly? || (cloud_license_enabled? && (perform_reconciliations? || ramp_enabled?))
      term_end_date
    else
      term_start_date.advance(years: 1)
    end

This issue addresses the need to automate provisioning for SaaS Ramp subscriptions.

Discovery work being completed in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754) informs what data is received from a Zuora Ramp deal by CustomersDot which is required to know how provisioning could handled for each ramp interval. You can find the results of a 3 year Ramp test for SaaS [here in this issue thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754#note_804427524).  As you can see, the subscription was provisioned in GL.com for the correct time period and quantity.  However, what's shown on the Manage Subscriptions page in CDot might be misleading as it shows the final state of the subscription (quantity 30).  That problem should be handled in a separate issue though as this should focus on provisioning only

## Proposal

### Start of Subscription
* No change to current process - Given the current state, provisioning should work automatically for the first ramp year as it syncs the quantity for the first ramp from Zuora to CustomersDot for the full subscription term.

### Successive Subscription Intervals
* Update the user's subscription license count to the correct value at the beginning of each ramp period
  * This will require a custom Zuora workflow that sends a callout to CustomersDot to update the .com subscription in subsequent years when the ramp interval changes as this does not currently exist.
  * The decision on whether a custom workflow callout can be used for this purpose was discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/145.  It was decided we will use a Zuora custom workflow for this trigger.
  * The custom workflow/callout is being tested as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4295.  In this issue, we can just verify the SaaS flow is working as expected once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4295 is complete.",3

# Feature Request

## Problem
The rollout of Zuora Ramps will result in a change to the current structure of a ramp deal. Instead of creating a separate opportunity, quote and subscription for each ramp interval, a single subscription will now include all intervals over multiple years. For deals that ramp in quantity over each interval, additional licenses need to be provisioned at the beginning of the interval. This issue addresses how to provision these ramp licenses for Self-Managed Subscriptions.

Discovery work being completed in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754) will inform what data is received from a Zuora Ramp deal by CustomersDot which is required to know how provisioning could handled for each ramp interval. You can find the results of a 3 year Ramp test for SM [here in the issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3754#note_807607785).  As you can see, the resulting license was generated for the correct initial time period (the 1st year of the ramp), but the quantity was incorrect.  The quantity was for the active/final ramp of the subscription (e.g. 30) instead of the initial ramp (e.g. 10).

## Proposal
### Start of Subscription
* For MVC Zuora Ramps launch (expected May 2022), follow current process of automated provisioning and send the customer both a cloud activation code and an offline cloud license file for year one of a multi-interval ramp deal
  * Ramp deals currently follow the [default Cloud Licensing behavior](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/527#super-sonics-fields-and-standard-exemptions), with the customer receiving both license types
  * With the launch of [Strict Cloud Licensing](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/-/epics/379), [Ramp deals will be no longer be an exemption and will be set to Yes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/526#post-update-state-of-cloud-licensing), with all Ramp customers receiving Cloud Licensing.
* Ensure the start date, end date, and quantity of the license generated for ramps is correct for both types of licenses, cloud and offline cloud.
  * Cloud: Make sure the licenses generated at activation and in subsequent seat link have the correct information based on the current subscription, and not the latest (active) data in Zuora.
  * Offline Cloud: Ensure the license generated by the `LicenseNotificationService` triggered by the callout uses the correct start date, end date, and quantity for the current subscription (e.g. first ramp year).

### Successive Subscription Intervals
For [MVC Zuora Ramps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/433#update-20211103), Sales will only be able to create annual ramp intervals. However, there may be rare instances created by Sales Ops for specific customers will a subscription could ramp semi-annually, quarterly or monthly.
* For Self-Managed licenses, provision as follows:
  * For annual ramps: support team to provision license(s) immediately at start of subscription year. This will follow their [existing process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/handling_multi-years_subscription.html).
  * For more granular ramp intervals: support team to provision license(s) immediately at start of interval based on service effective dates. This will follow their [existing process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/handling_multi-years_subscription.html).

NOTE: Ramp deals that increase in price only each interval will not require any manual licensing.


## Next steps (if any)
* Evaluate/implement automated provisioning of successive Ramp intervals to remove Support burden of manual provisioning. Work being tracked in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7192).

102396578,2022-01-31 21:21:41.721,[SaaS] Send introductory email about user overages after renewal,"## Problem to solve

SaaS customers are being surprised and taken off-guard by Quarterly Subscription reconciliations. Because self-service SaaS customers have not historically been charged true-ups, the QSR process and the fact that they have to pay for overages is totally new. See tickets from customers [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/337).

## Intended users

This issue is just for SaaS customers.

* Group Owners of a group who have just renewed (manually or auto-renewed) a subscription
* Only groups enrolled in quarterly subscription reconciliation. See exactly which use cases we're solving for in the [Epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229#saas-customers).

## Proposal

After a subscription has been **renewed (manually or auto-renewed)** for a group in GitLab, send an email to **all** group Owners 1 day after a subscription has been renewed to make them aware of how users are counted and how overages are handled.

We should send an email to all group Owners (not just the group Owner who purchased the subscription), because all group Owners should be aware of the overage behavior.

### Design

Subject line: Managing users in your subscription

Dear [customer],

Thank you for renewing your GitLab.com subscription! As you get started, we want to make sure you understand some important billing information.

Your subscription cost is based on the maximum number of seats you use during the billing period. If you reach the number of seats in your subscription, you can continue to add users, but GitLab bills you for the overage. These bills occur every quarter.

Read more about quarterly reconciliation in [our product documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html).

If you have any questions about this process, [please reach out](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293). We are happy to assist.

Thank you for your business!

101297214,2022-01-26 15:19:13.151,Spike: New Subscriptions API endpoint to support E-Disty,"# Purpose

Related to the discussions in the [Purchasing Reliability WG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m6sozlyvEIEKcEIPF2_nujrYTOV3IPpx_jaPXD1hPpU/edit), the purpose of this issue is to research what changes need to be made in CustomersDot to support requests from Platypus to create customers and subscriptions that originate from orders in Arrowsphere.  

The original purpose of this issue was to evaluate how far a request from Platypus could get using the existing APIs in CDot.  My finding can be [found below](#original-exercise).  Now that we have those results, we are officially starting the planning and design phase of the MVC build.  The outcomes of this issue will be an epics with issues outlining the CustomersDot development work related to supporting a new API for E-Disty.

## Original Exercise

We were tasked with seeing how far a Platypus request could get using [this sample payload from Platypus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/integrations/platypus/-/snippets/2235036) to create a subscription in CustomersDot using the existing `/subscriptions` API endpoint. 

After looking at the payload, we found some issues that had to be addressed before we could attempt the CDot request. 
 See the notes below for more details.

TLDR: The main blocker is that the current CDot endpoint expects a logged-in customer to make the request.  We would likely need to make changes to both the payload from platypus and to our API endpoint. Let's discuss how we might be able to solve for these problems.

<details><summary>Notes</summary>

## CDot subscriptions/create endpoint using Platypus Payload

This document describes how this sample request payload from Platypus could be used to feed into the subscriptions/create endpoint in CDot.  I've added a mapping below to help illustrate.

## Summary

In short, the payload cannot be simply fed into the CDot endpoint without some adjustments.

- The payload from Platypus would need to be transformed into a request body structure that CDot expects.
- The endpoint requires a logged in CDot Customer (but doesn't have to have a Zuora account yet).  This customer data is used to build the subscribe API request body.
  - The Platypus payload seems to contain the data required to create a Customer.
  - We don't receive a VAT code in Platypus but it doesn't seem like this is required in Zuora.
- A `payment_method_id` is require unless the plan is a community plan and a `coupon_code` param is included.

## Mapping CDot create params to Platypus payload

### Mapped params

```ruby
params['plan_id'] => payload['orderLines'][0]['productId']
params['products']['main']['quantity'] => payload['orderLines'][0]['quantity']
```

### Required CDot params that are missing from Platypus payload

```ruby
params['payment_method_id']
```

### Optional CDot params

```ruby
params['payment_method'], # CC if not set.  Could be set to `wire_transfer`
params['customer_email'], # Not sure if this is used
params['customer_token'], # Not sure if this is used
params['order_total'], # Possibly for display purposes only
params['total_without_taxes'], # Possibly for display purposes only
params['order_status'], # Possibly for display purposes only
params['source'], # Possibly for display purposes only; set on the Order record in CDot (e.g. upgrade or new)
params['gl_namespace_id'], # Set on the Order record in CDot for SaaS
params['gl_namespace_name'], # Set on the Order record in CDot for SaaS
params['preview'], # Boolean for previewing order before purchase
params['subscription_id'], # Used for adding a new product to an existing subscription
```

## Detailed breakdown of how the Subscribe API payload is constructed

The request body is made up of 6 main elements, listed in more detail below: `account`, `bill_to_contact`, `payment_method`, `subscribe_options`, `subscription_data`, `preview_options`.

### account (for new Zuora customer)

```ruby
{
  name: customer.company,
  communication_profile_id: APP_CONFIG.zuora.default_profile_id,
  currency: 'USD',
  bill_cycle_day: Date.current.day,
  payment_term: 'Due Upon Receipt',
  batch: batch,
  auto_pay: enable_auto_pay?,
  vat_id: customer.vat_code
}
```

#### OR (for existing Zuora customer)

```ruby
{
  id: customer.zuora_account_id,
  batch: batch
}
```

### bill_to_contact (only for new Zuora customers)

```ruby
{
  first_name: customer.first_name,
  last_name: customer.last_name,
  country: customer.country,
  city: customer.city,
  address1: customer.address_1,
  address2: customer.address_2,
  state: customer.state,
  postal_code: customer.zip_code,
  work_email: customer.email
}
```

### payment_method

```ruby
{ id: params[:payment_method_id] } # if params[:payment_method_id] is present
```

### subscribe_options

```ruby
attrs = {
  generate_invoice: true,
  process_payments: process_payments?
  subscribe_invoice_processing_options: {
    invoice_date: Date.current,
    invoice_processing_scope: 'Subscription',
    invoice_target_date: Date.current
  }
}
attrs[:external_payment_options] = { payment_method_id: PaymentMethod::WIRE_TRANSFER_ID } # if payment_method is `wire_transfer`
```

### subscription_data

```ruby
{
  rate_plan_data: rate_plans, # array of amendment options using the plan and quantity
  subscription: {
    contract_effective_date: Date.current,
    service_activation_date: Date.current,
    initial_term: TERM_DURATION_IN_MONTHS, # 12
    renewal_term: TERM_DURATION_IN_MONTHS  # 12
  }.merge(subscription_custom_fields) # Includes values for custom fields on Subscription for Super Sonics
}
```

### preview_options

```ruby
{ enable_preview_mode: true } # if preview param is true
```

</details>

## Data Mapping

The team has collaborated on a data mapping exercise between Platypus, CDot, Zuora Billing, and SFDC (TBD).  The following spreadsheet shows how the data will flow from Arrow via Platypus payload into the CDot data model and ultimately into Zuora Billing via a Zuora Subscribe API request:

101294143,2022-01-26 14:43:34.888,Fix the IronBank schema export,"### Problem

As [described in the README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#ironbank), we should be able to update the IronBank schema files using the command `IronBank::Schema.export` in a rails console.  However, when working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4279, it was noticed that this command stalls.  

When the schema is being exported via IronBank, [the Zuora `describe` API endpoint is used](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/describe/object.rb#L20) for [each object name](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/describe/tenant.rb#L46) returned by [the top level describe API request](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/describe/tenant.rb#L15).  In development (which uses Zuora API sandbox), this process stalls when the describe endpoint is called for certain object names (like `ApplicationGroup`).

CustomerDot has overridden the `object_names` method [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/266480162afe740fa1cbc9049dabd600c537110e/lib/zuora/describe/tenant.rb#L17) (from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/669) to be pulled from a hard-coded set of object names [in `config/zuora/rest_objects.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/6b8978605499bc74aa3d3cdee8b1afaf5d10858f/config/zuora/rest_objects.yml#L1).  From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/669, it's not exactly clear why it's necessary to use a hard-coded list of object names instead of pulling the available set from Zuora like IronBank does by default.  Using the default logic, allows the schema export to work again.

It's not clear when this export stopped working, but I'm thinking it might be after the latest update to our Zuora tenant for API Sandbox.

### Proposal

Determine why the hard-coded list of object names is necessary.  If it is, trim the list to those needed for CDot that are still relevant.  It might be necessary to make environment specific `rest_objects.yml` files.

### Result

A working IronBank schema export.",5

This is mainly a follow-up of [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3261#note_583878232).

## Problem

The tooltip implementation does not look like a bon-a-fide Bootstrap tooltip, but rather, it looks like the native browser dependent implementation which sometimes works with `title`

Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title

There's some significant downsides to this browser implementation, most importantly that it doesn't do anything on focus (only sometimes on mouse hover).  The `rails_admin` gem comes baked in with some bootstrap scripts, including the tooltip one, but it's only applied to table headers.

Ref: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/blob/97ccc28940d65fee53b30c409c49032fbb0885db/app/assets/javascripts/rails_admin/ui.js#L97


## Proposal

In the main GitLab project, there is a class `has-tooltip` which is used to programmatically create a Bootstrap tooltip for a thing:

87517947,2021-05-21 15:28:06.622,Manual license sync doesn't work after initial sync for a day,"### Problem

Once a license has been synced (through manual or automation) on a given day, no additional manual syncing works until the next report day.  This happens because the seat link sync request from the SM instance is [sent with a timestamp using the current time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/63ef05526c260a0e8679a7acc9589e83a144f22e/ee/app/models/gitlab/seat_link_data.rb#L16).  In other words, each sync request will have a unique `timestamp` in the request.  A `date` param is also included in the payload which is derived from the date of the `timestamp` [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/63ef05526c260a0e8679a7acc9589e83a144f22e/ee/app/models/gitlab/seat_link_data.rb#L54).

In CustomersDot, [the `SeatLinkCreateService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d2a3c2aed8894dd660eed62cdcc323d2427205ec/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb) is responsible for processing the sync request.  It is supposed to [look up an existing `LicenseSeatLink` record using `timestamp`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d2a3c2aed8894dd660eed62cdcc323d2427205ec/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L36) if present (which it would be on newer versions of EE), otherwise it uses the `date` param.  However, since the timestamp is different from the earlier sync, instead of finding/using the existing `LicenseSeatLink` record for that report date, the service initializes a new one.  When it attempts to save the record, it fails due to the [validation on `report_date`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/7cf930e839e6324c784ebd6e9319805eca2ca034/app/models/license_seat_link.rb#L8) which verifies uniqueness scoped to `order_id` and `self_managed_instance_activation_id`.

[Sample Sentry Error](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2600316/events/6143dd6af3364209a21d85299b023d3f/)

### Proposal

This service should be updated to allow multiple syncs in a report day.  After discussing options with the team, we've agreed to the following plan as [mentioned here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3163#note_585143061).

1. [x] Update the `SeatLinkCreateService` to find or create `LicenseSeatLink` records using `self_managed_instance_activation`, in addition to the existing fields (`report_timestamp|date` and `zuora_subscription_name`)

   * MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3344 (Verified)
1. [x] Update the `CreateReconciliationService` to only update an existing reconciliation record if the new `user_count` is greater than the previous `user_count` ([code reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/42318b047ab9c347277f9a9416e1ec0624187d3d/app/services/create_reconciliation_service.rb#L40)).
   * MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3352 (Verified)
1. [x] When a new seat link record is received, if the `report_timestamp` is not included in the request, set it to `report_date 03:00 UTC`.
   * MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3356 (Verified)
1. [x] Populate all existing rows where `report_timestamp is NULL` to set `report_timestamp` to `report_date 03:00 UTC`. Set DB constraint for `report_timestamp` to `null: false`.  Remove `report_timestamp` method from `LicenseSeatLink` model.
   * https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3360 (Verified)

87464465,2021-05-20 21:23:17.027,Remove the CustomersDot plans page and direct users to the marketing pricing page,"## Problem to solve

* The Customers Dot plans page https://customers.gitlab.com/plans is hard to maintain and update the pricing information to match the marketing site
* We are in the process of moving all SaaS purchase flows into GitLab (Subscriptions + addon products). Once we have completed that work, the `customersDot/pricing` page will become redundant for the purpose of addon products.
* The CustomersDot plans page is not best entry point for SM customers to start their purchasing journey. The marketing site does a much better of job of displaying the tiers with additional information. Not to mention on `customersDot/pricing` we link back to the marketing site for more information.

## Proposal

Remove the CustomersDot plans page.

- For a user who is not logged in, the home page of `customers.gitlab.com` should be the login page
- For a user who is logged in, the Manage purchases page will be the home page
     - Create an empty state for the Manage purchases page (The manage purchases page currently redirects to the plans page if there are no purchases, so this behavior will need to change)
     - The `Buy new subscription` button will link to the [pricing page on the marketing website](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)

#### Design

- See design section
- [See Figma for specs](https://www.figma.com/file/cAKBLLR5KluMCux2byl68x/Remove-the-CustomersDot-plans-page?node-id=3%3A1503)


### Documentation

We will need to update all references to the CustomersDot plans page in the docs. 

Is there a way to search the docs for all instances of links to `customers.gitlab.com/plans`? I found a couple and listed them below, but I am sure there are more.

### Problem

Right now we send too many data and plans to gitlab.com, like `deprecated`, `hide_card` attributes. 

### Proposal

I believe they are redundant and should not be send at all. I propose to do all the logic on the CustomersDot side and send only relevant information otherwise we are spreading our logic across two applications which leads to issues like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61990

In addition, changing available plans will require changes in **both** repositories and that increases the delivery time of a feature.

### Situation

We recently introduced a new UI element in the Subscription Component to make it possible for customers to copy an `Activation Code` (gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#3006). See example here:

||
|-|
|![](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/06008e55d9154849ffe5ddb36442c7da/Screenshot_2021-04-27_at_07.28.59.png)|

(There's also have a `Copy license file` action and the 2 actions are mutually exclusive).

### Complication

The Subscription story does not contain a case for this meaning the smoke tests are not taking this scenario into account.

### Proposal

Given we added storyshots for smoke tests (gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#932), let's add this scenario to the Subscription stories.

### Result

Besides having the new scenario covered, we would expect a (slight) increase in coverage.",2

(This error on [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2626906/))

This error, which can happen randomly, means that we didn't manage to retrieve a subscription for a given order from Zuora.

### Steps to reproduce

run the `orders:downgrade_expired_subscriptions` task in production.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Error triggers and rake task stops.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The fact that we get this error when retrieving a subscription for one order should not be a reason to stop the rake task, we should carry on in processing the remaining orders.",2
86980460,2021-05-12 20:40:43.804,Prevent HTTP Requests When No VCR Cassette Is Loaded,"### Problem

We appear to allow HTTP requests to be made by the test suite when VCR does not have any cassettes loaded:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/34e3aa33adfd643f98d6ce3277a8fc449393d893/spec/support/vcr.rb#L6

This makes it too easy to accidentally write a test that makes real HTTP requests every time it runs.

Here's one example of how this can happen:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3209#note_570376985

In short, if we use `let_it_be` with a factory that makes HTTP requests, then this will bypass VCR and always make real HTTP requests.  This makes it very easy to accidentally slip real HTTP requests into the test suite.  And there may be other ways this can happen.

Here's another place we're we've discussed this being an issue:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2565#note_558470717

I [made an MR to experiment with changing this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3217) within the scope of ~""Stuff that should Just Work"".  In doing so, I discovered that we have a few tests that seem to make HTTP requests every test run.  Here is one such instance caused by using `let_it_be`: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3217/diffs#808512b32fff3a0a4332697e4a370a042f91ae1a_748_748

One easy way to verify that the test suite is bypassing VCR and attempting to make real HTTP requests is to disconnect from the network (disable your wifi, unplug your ethernet cable, etc) and then run the following spec: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/34e3aa33adfd643f98d6ce3277a8fc449393d893/spec/controllers/subscriptions_controller_spec.rb#L747

It will generate errors like the following:

```
Faraday::ConnectionFailed:
  Failed to open TCP connection to rest.apisandbox.zuora.com:443 (getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known)
```

In contrast, it passes locally if the network is enabled.

#### Notes

Here are just a few further notes from code spelunking this:

This appears to be the magic that lets us use `:vcr` in our specs to get VCR to automatically find and load cassettes:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/98e48709688a0478ec245b0e2155b545c5986940/spec/support/vcr.rb#L9

That function is here in VCR:  https://github.com/vcr/vcr/blob/5c0ded824dd8b1f9d50ab5d48a53be065b94ece8/lib/vcr/configuration.rb#L420

Which uses RSpec’s `config.before(:each)` to load cassettes:  https://github.com/vcr/vcr/blob/5c0ded824dd8b1f9d50ab5d48a53be065b94ece8/lib/vcr/test_frameworks/rspec.rb#L35

Which seems to run after `before(:all)` (see the Order section):  https://rubydoc.info/github/rspec/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Hooks

`let_it_be` seems to be equivalent to using `before_all`:  https://test-prof.evilmartians.io/#/recipes/let_it_be?id=modifiers

Which I think ultimately uses `before(:all)` under the hood: https://github.com/test-prof/test-prof/blob/7d8effe48fa65418b0ee9a77d932d86fed240b51/lib/test_prof/recipes/rspec/before_all.rb

I’m not sure I’m tracing through all that 100% correctly, but it’s in the ballpark.

### Proposal

Let's [change this line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/34e3aa33adfd643f98d6ce3277a8fc449393d893/spec/support/vcr.rb#L6) to `c.allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette = false` so that HTTP requests are always denied in the test suite unless we specifically allow them for a particular test.

Unfortunately, I haven't found a clear way to disable VCR and allow http requests for specific tests, which may be why we currently have `allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette` set to `true`.

But perhaps something like the following may work:

```ruby
WebMock.allow_net_connect!
VCR.turn_off!
```

Followed by the following to re-enable VCR and prevent HTTP connections:

```ruby
WebMock.disable_net_connect!
VCR.turn_on!
```

Or maybe tests that require HTTP connections should be moved to the QA test suite?

Maybe there are other ways to solve this?

### Result

Our test suite will stop leaking HTTP requests.

It will be harder to accidentally make HTTP requests from the test suite.  VCR / WebMock will always block the requests unless clearly disabled for a particular spec.

### Next steps (if any)

### How will we measure success?",5

86760810,2021-05-10 07:20:18.406,Remove individual usages of aggregate_failures,"## Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3214#note_571133280 `aggregate_failures` was used within an individual test case.

While working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2748, an investigated VCR cassette didn't have a corresponding spec. While digging further into this it turned out that it isn't used at all. After running the test suite to detect unused cassettes with a command (`VCR_REPORT_UNUSED_CASSETTES=true bundle exec rspec`) from the my local reverse search in the terminal, nothing turned up. Looking into to the definition of the prefix, it turned out that only `1` is accepted as a value. Previously `true` was also working but that was changed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2579.

It also turns out that the CI/CD variable for `VCR_REPORT_UNUSED_CASSETTES` for the pipelines is set to `true`.

### Proposal

- [x] Remove all unused VCR cassettes

### Problem

@a_luna @amandarueda looking at the data coming over to salesforce, it looks like we had a bad mapping for what we are sending to Effective Price: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L310

That line should be using the Invoice Item Unit Price field and not the Charge Amount. I see that this object is created by Zuora::InvoiceItem, and want to make sure that this might be an additional field it needs instead of a complete change at that level as I do not know what else is using the Charge Amount.

### Proposal

The `effective_price` value sent to the [`CreateRatePlanChargeService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9f0fd64a397a5fc3ff3ea3a5e9131ac7fd3f30c9/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_rate_plan_charge_service.rb) should map to `InvoiceItem->Unit Price` instead of `InvoiceItem->Charge Amount`.

[This line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/salesforce/create_opportunity_objects_service.rb#L310) needs to change to `effective_price: invoice_item.unit_price`

### Problem

While running the rake task to update subscriptions in Zuora with their namespace data (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2962), some orders came through with a subscription name but there was no corresponding subscription object when trying to access `order.subscription` (relevant [method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b1bb01424444a4f020dd58458e9679eb3ce970fa/app/models/order.rb#L117-135)). Because of this we didn't update the subscription in Zuora because `order.subscription&.z_subscription` was `nil`.

Not really sure if this really is a problem, but just wanted to flag it and check since there were some active SAAS non-trial orders like this.

#### Examples

I grabbed these from the task output (there were many more)

```
order1 = Order.find 114699
=> #<Order id: 114699, REDACTED >
order1.subscription_name
=> ""A-S00033377""
order1.subscription
=> nil

order2 = Order.find 115401
=> #<Order id: 115401, REDACTED >
order2.subscription_name
=> ""A-S00033654""
order2.subscription
=> nil
```

### Proposal

- Generate a report with all orders that do not have a subscription object.
- Trace origin of the order.
- Determine possible cause.
- Based on determination above, plan for remediation such that the order becomes correctly formed or properly cancelled.

85210766,2021-04-14 23:08:11.603,Some Auto-Renewals in CustomersDot are throwing errors and not renewing,"### Problem

**Based on the data found in Zuora for Subscriptions with `Enter a number of active users greater than or equal to your current` ERROR recorded in the Subscription Notes field, the first occurrence was on February 19, 2021.**

**Summary:**
There seems to be an issue with the CustomersDot Auto-Renewal flow that is sometimes causing only the upgrade portion (UpdateProduct amendment) of a customer's renewal to be recorded in Zuora and then terminate with out an actual renewal. In some cases no UpdateProduct amendment is done and an error is recorded instead. There is also no copy of this, even the upgrade part, being sent to SFDC.

The only other explanation I can think of is that a customer made it to the True-up flow and then decided to walk away and not move forward, but CustomersDot still sent Zuora the upgrade portion.

**Possible Impacts and Effects:**
1. I am not sure of the experience these customers receive, if the flow seems to work or they receive an error.
1. Licenses might not be being sent out to the customer.
1. Invoices might not be being generated for these transactions.
1. Despite the customer taking action in the web store (by the presence of the seat increase) we are effectively letting their subscription run out on them.
1. These upgrade/renewals are not being sent to Salesforce, lowering our Net ARR attainment as it looks like there were going to upgrade.
1. In fact we are churning many of these renewals in Salesforce because of the lack of renewal. We have taken **~125k of Churn (-$125k Net ARR)** related to these subs so far this year that might have to be reversed.

**Findings**:
The Sales team raised some good examples of strange Net ARR data on some of march's churned opportunities and we dug into their Zuora Subscription data and found examples of subscriptions ending with an additional seats purchase but then no extension of their term (renewal). 

Both examples below have this in their Notes field, which looks like there was an issue with the the True up behavior in the renewal flow: `RENEWAL_ERROR: ${:code=>“RENEWAL_ERROR”, :message=>“Enter a number of active users greater than or equal to your current number of active users (10)“}$` which originates from: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L243

- Example 1: https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=2c92a00d77fc14ea017809fc0a27731e
- Example 2: https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=2c92a00777f8d0860177fa8912370fce (Note: Billing actually finds this one and is confused about the lack of Invoice or Web Direct, and then Ammends the customer back to their old seat count: https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/5004M00000j6rRg)

**Further Analysis:**
- Using the `RENEWAL_ERROR` in the Notes field as a marker, I was able to find 264 Subscriptions with an error. All but 1 of the subscriptions was created since 2/19/2021.
- Doing a cross reference using our Customer Subscription system in Salesforce, I was able to find 56 Renewals that have been Closed Lost since 2/19/2021 totaling ~-$150k Net ARR. These were closed lost as part of standard Sales Ops clean up of expired subscriptions. If these churns were in error that loss of Net ARR should be reversed and any additional users would be positive Net ARR. I have attached a scrubbed csv for anyone else who wants to review.

cc @james_harrison @lschoenfeld @tav_scott this is the end findings of the Opps that you all raised today. Please watch this issue for any developments as Fulfillment investigates.

### Proposal

Look into the use cases mentioned and why renewals amendments aren't being created. Specifically:

1. Subscriptions renewing for less quantity than the previous term #2837 
   1. Currently in this case, only the error gets recorded and no Amendments made.
   1. Example: https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=2c92a00d77b9842f0177b99ba8c403c9
1. Subscriptions renewing for more quantity than the previous term
   1. Example: This subscription had UpdateProduct amendment, but then an Error and no auto-renewal. https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=2c92a00c77bf60da0177c1e313380c06


### Result

Auto-renewals will happen for all subscriptions that are either increasing or decreasing Users.

This example from production shows two errors, first there's a [`Restforce::ErrorCode::UnableToLockRow`](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2465506/events/40134490/) which causes a  [`Salesforce::OpportunityNotCreated`](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2448958/events/40134492/) in `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityWorker`.

With the `create_opportunity_objects` feature flag in staging, the error appears when creating the quote. [Restforce::ErrorCode::CannotInsertUpdateActivateEntity](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersstggitlabcom/issues/2448888/) prevents the creation of the quote and all its related objects.

### Challenges

:balloon: The error appears to be random

:balloon: Since it's apparently random, the error is not very easy to reproduce locally

### Proposal

Rescue these Restforce errors and retry the creation of opportunity objects (`Quote`, `Quote Amendment`, `Rate Plan` and `Rate Plan Charge`) while avoiding re-creating already created ones.

### Result

We avoid having transactions missing their opportunity or quote record in SFDC.

### Problem

We want to seat link even when the instance does not have data on active user counts. This is because the other goal of seat link, which is syncing the license, is equally important.

### Proposal

Mark `license_seat_links` table's `active_user_count` and `max_histoical_user_count` columns to be nullable.

Allow seat link to occur even when no counts information is present

84814007,2021-04-07 17:18:26.486,Test new ProductRatePlan for the Education Enterprise Subscription (staging only),"### Summary

This came up in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/issues/3487#note_546727243

The Edu PnP creates a new ""**Enterprise Education Subscription**"" for qualifying educational institutions that allows institutions to purchase our top-tier subscriptions, at a discount, in bulk, for the entire institution without use case or seat limitations. The price point is based on the size of the institution, of which there are four size classes. Institutions may request any number of seats per one of the SKUs up to the size of their total enrollment.

The product rate plan needs to be set up as a FlatFee and therefore a Quantity of 1. The expectation is that it should provision a specific number of seats (greater than 1).  Because our current provisioning process is reliant on the quantity to be passed, it was suggested to figure out a way to have Zuora product rate plan also pass the quantity, while keeping the FlatFee charge.

For additional information about how this Zuora setup idea came about, please see [agenda notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBUJTh2qLn17OwT79kHrJ1IWY0cifRVqdNtAZx3KSFY/edit#heading=h.w1i69kcg4lck). 

### Proposal

Perform testing in Zuora Sandbox / CustomersDot Stage for the proposed new Product Rate Plan.

@mquitevis has created a test Product Rate Plan with 2 Product Rate Plan Charges under [`SaaS - Ultimate` product](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/Product.do?method=view&id=2c92c0f97700a4f701770609612c2395).

### Problem

When a deal sales process finishes for new or renewals, the customer gets an email with instructions to use their purchase. The customer's account team doesn't receive this email notification. 

In some or most cases in my experience, the customer asks support to activate their licenses or subscription to their account team; then the account team needs:
  - Figure out if the email was or wasn't sent.
  - If so, check who was supposed to receive the email.
  - In case the primary contact is wrong,  start an internal support process to solve it, guide the customer to open a support ticket to change the primary contact, and support the customer to activate their purchase.

### Proposal

- [x] Include  the account team in copy to the subscription/licence notifications email. 
  - [ ] Define who should receive this notification in CC.
     - [ ] SAL/AE only
     - [ ] SAL/AE + SDR
     - [ ] SA/AE + SDR + SA
     - [x] SA/AE + SDR + SA + TAM (if apply) 


### Result

As soon as we close a deal, the account team knows whether the email was sent to the correct contact or no.
If the customer asks for help, the account team has all the information to forward the email to the right persona without opening other internal processes.
In this email, the account team can guide the customer on changing the customer portal's administrator if they need it by opening a support ticket. 

### Next steps (if any)

TBD

Part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2112

Currently the `Salesforce::FindOrCreateLeadService` service is triggering an inline API call to Salesforce in order to find or create a Lead.

The service is used in the following sections:

- `CreateSalesforceLeadFromCustomerService`
  - Used in `Api::CustomersController#create`
  - Used in `RegistrationsController#create`
- `Gitlab::BaseTrialService`
  - Ingerited by `Gitlab::HostedPlans::CreateTrialService`
  - Inherited by `Gitlab::SelfHostedPlans::CreateTrialService`
  - Both services are used in `TrialsController#create`

As we can see, if there is an error with the API call, the customer registration or trial generation can be broken.

### Problem

When a user changes the name of their namespace in GitLab.com, the subscription object in CustomersDot gets out of sync because there's no notice of that change. In CustomersDot the customer still sees the outdated name of the namespace in their subscriptions page.

It's only after a change in the linked namespace for the subscription that the subscription object gets the updated `gl_namespace_name`.

### Proposal

Make a call to CustomersDot when the namespace name changes in GitLab.com to update the `gl_namespace_name` of the subscription.

### Result

Both `gl_namespace_name` and `gl_namespace_id` are kept up to date in GitLab.com, CustomersDot and Zuora (through the functionality implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1989)

## Delivery plan

This logic is part of a bigger picture :frame_photo: 
- [x] CustomersDot: Add endpoint that receives a namespace(id, name) and updates the namespace name for all the orders associated to this namespace: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3797

81697915,2021-03-26 09:09:31.585,"Investigate Salesforce Account inconsistencies in CustomersDot, Salesforce and Zuora","### Problem
In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2671 it was noticed that while the CustomersDot's customer stores a Salesforce Account Id its associated record in Salesforce could not be found (more info [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2671#note_532386353)). This resulted in a raised error due to relying on always finding a record which was fixed in the mentioned issue.

Now the issue is that the a [presence validation exception](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2542134/?referrer=slack) will be raised when the Salesforce Account is empty and an Opportunity is supposed to be created. This is because since it needs the information of an `OwnerId`. That field belongs to the Salesforce Account. More info regarding this can be found in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2883).

### Proposal
Investigate the inconsistency around the Salesforce Account in CustomersDot, Salesforce and Zuora. As suggested by @jbrennan1 in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2671#note_537873407) a walkthrough/demo with him through the standard Account/Contact creation flow is the first step of this investigation.

The actual fix for the exception will be handled in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2883.

While working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2671 a fix was implemented to not raise an exception when the Salesforce Account can't be found and instead proceed with the remaining logic. While the remaining code accounted for the Salesforce Account to be blank all along, it never reached that code with an empty Salesforce Account before due to the mentioned exception. Which is why we are now seeing a [presence validation exception](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2542134/?referrer=slack) that the `OwnerId` for a new `Opportunity` can't be blank.

### Proposal

After the investigation in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2884#note_813196718), we want to:

81651791,2021-03-25 15:01:05.397,Avoid using customer relationship for subscription methods on the Order model,"## Purpose

There are many cases where Orders in CDot production have a `zuora_account_id` value but the Customer of the Order does not have a `zuora_account_id`.  This can be a problem when getting the [`subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/1b7fff46aa9ef908e33311e26999c8fb41d6c873/app/models/order.rb#L117) or [`current_subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/1b7fff46aa9ef908e33311e26999c8fb41d6c873/app/models/order.rb#L137) for an order.  These methods use the `order.customer.zuora_account_id` instead of `order.zuora_account_id`.  The subscription won't be found for those orders when it actually exists in Zuora.  

We should consider updating these subscription methods or if there are any negative consequences.  Some changes were made in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4551, as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3837.  

There may be other changes necessary to make as we are still seeing reports where provisioning fails due to the relationship of the Customer on the Order. As recently as April 28 2022, [this was reported as a problem](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/286138) (originally raised in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2118#note_928465165).

81650767,2021-03-25 14:47:08.909,Investigate why some orders and customers do not have a zuora_account_id,"## Purpose

It was discovered that some orders in CustomersDot production do not have a `zuora_account`.  This is expected for some orders like trials and orders that revert to the free plan.  After filtering those out, there are still some orders (around 22 at the time of writing this) where `zuora_account_id` is nil.

Similarly, there are some customers attached to orders that do not have a `zuora_account_id` either.  There are even more customers without `zuora_account_id` than orders mentioned above.  

Please see the detailed comment referenced below for more info.  It would be good to figure out why this has happened, whether it is a problem, and if so, provide a solution.

## Follow-up

The following discussion is from !2985:

- [ ] @tyleramos made the [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2985#note_537877774):

    > @lulalala Thanks for raising this as a concern! This will indeed be a problem.
    > 
    > I've done some investigation into our production data and there are many orders where `zuora_account_id` is nil. However, for `Order#current_subscription`, it's actually the `customer.zuora_account_id` that needs to be present. It looks like [this method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/6e353a98934a4878a07843e08605a1fdfcb8c9b2/app/models/subscription.rb#L37) doesn't actually use the `zuora_account_id` on the order itself. The same concern exists thought that `customer.zuora_acocunt_id` could be `nil`. In fact, I think the situation is actually a little worse because we use `customer.zuora_account_id`, but more on that in a bit.
    > 
    > Let's breakdown the orders where `order.zuora_account_id` is nil a bit:
    > 
    > ```
    > irb(main):001:0> Order.count
    > => 156049
    > irb(main):002:0> Order.where(zuora_account_id: nil).count
    > => 111447
    > ```
    > 
    > Out of 156049 total orders, 111447 do not have `zuora_account_id` so that seems bad. But once we filter out trials, and trials that reverted back to the free plan, it looks much better.
    > 
    > ```
    > irb(main):034:0> Order.where(zuora_account_id: nil).where(trial: false).where.not(product_rate_plan_id: 'free-plan-id').count
    > => 22
    > ```
    > 
    > So really only 22 orders that could be a problem. I didn't dig into these too much but it seems like they could be trials that didn't transition to non-trials correctly. Either way, this is a much smaller, manageable number. I might open an issue to determine if these need to be addressed.
    > 
    > Circling back to the fact that `order.current_subscription`, and `order.subscription` for that matter, use `customer.zuora_account_id`. There are even more orders that aren't trial or free plan where the `customer.zuora_account_id` is nil.
    > 
    > ```
    > irb(main):054:0> Order.left_outer_joins(:customer).where(customers: { zuora_account_id: nil }, trial: false).where.not(product_rate_plan_id: 'free-plan-id').count
    > => 265
    > ```
    > 
    > Of these 265 orders, 48 of them are managed by resellers because the `login_activated` attr is false.
    > 
    > ```
    > irb(main):060:0> Order.left_outer_joins(:customer).where(customers: { zuora_account_id: nil, login_activated: false }, trial: false).where.not(product_rate_plan_id: 'free-plan-id').count
    > => 48
    > ```
    > 
    > The remaining 217 orders are still mysterious. After spot checking the papertrail for a few, it looks like the customer.zuora_account_id was set but previously, but removed by gitlab admins. It would be good to understand why this is done. The bigger question though is should update the subscription methods in Order to use `order.zuora_account_id` instead of `customer.zuora_account_id` as this might be less error prone?

### Summary

When purchasing a product that is taxed, the ""Price"" line item number incorrectly includes the tax.

### Steps to reproduce

In production, begin a purchase of CI Minutes with your address set to Denver, CO 80223.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

When purchasing a product that is taxed, the ""Price"" line item number incorrectly includes the tax.

Note that the order total is correct and the customer is not getting overcharged. This is just an issue with how the numbers are displaying.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The ""Price"" line item should only be the price of the product itself without any taxes. The taxes should only appear in the ""Estimated taxes"" line item. In the example below, ""Price"" should be $40.

### Problem

At the moment the New Subscription Components for GitLab and EE are sharing quite a good amount of logic, therefore demanding every update to be ported in many places. Increasing the risk of inconsistencies and the time for maintenance.

### Proposal

Consider:

- `app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/new_gitlab_subscription_form.vue`
- `app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/new_ee_subscription_form.vue`

We have 2 viable strategies (not necessarily mutually excluding):
1. individuate the parts that can be easily extracted into new/shared components and move them there OR
1. generalize the component and add props customize the parts that are different
1. moving the duplicate values into constants and referencing those instead

Finally, update the tests where applicable.

### Result

Reduction of code and decreased maintenance time in the future.

## Summary

When a subscription renews, and the active seat count is less than the original purchased amount, it tries to renew at the active (lower) seat count than the previous term, which produces an error and subscription doesn't renew.  This applies to both Self-Managed and SaaS.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create a SaaS subscription which will expire next date for 3 users
1. Set the subscription to autorenew (utilizing custom_autorenew setting in Zuora or by selecting from frontend Customers Portal)
1. Associate the subscription with a GitLab group
1. Ensure the GitLab group has 2 or less users
1. When the subscription attempts to renew, it will error

80951169,2021-03-15 16:58:53.135,Exclude unnecessary fields from IronBank Schema files,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2825, we found out that it can be problematic when custom fields are renamed or removed from Zuora, if those fields are listed in the IronBank Schema ([sandbox files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/tree/staging/config/zuora/sandbox/schema), [prod files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/tree/staging/config/zuora/production/schema)).  Since the schema files are used when IronBank builds queries to pull data from Zuora resources, changes to the fields in Zuora without being reflected in the Schema results in `IronBank::BadRequestError` errors.

### Proposal

To help avoid these types of errors, we probably should exclude any fields in queries which are not needed directly by CustomersDot.  This could be done by adding these fields to [`excluded_files.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/6b8978605499bc74aa3d3cdee8b1afaf5d10858f/config/zuora/sandbox/excluded_fields.yml).  This should prevent these fields from being included in the Zuora queries ([ref from IronBank](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/metadata.rb#L31)).  If that approach doesn't work, we could simply remove the fields from the schema altogether.

This might be the best course of action:
- Update all the schema files to get the lastest by exporting: `IronBank::Schema.export`.
- Audit each field for each Resource and add any fields not used by CustomersDot to the `excluded_files.yml`
- This will likely cause specs to fail because the Zuora requests are different. VCR cassettes will need to be re-recorded.

The above could be done for Sandbox first, then later for Production.",5
80939414,2021-03-15 14:33:27.318,PlansFinder should search for plans in Zuora if not found within eager loaded plans,"### Problem

If a product rate plan is not in the [list of preloaded plan ids](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L11) in `PlansFinder` and this plan id is used in [`PlansFinder.find`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L49), the result is `nil`, even if the product rate plan exists in Zuora.  This can lead to errors when a subscription is created or updated which uses a product rate plan not listed in the PlansFinder.  The results in the Zuora worker failing to process the callout which means no Order record is created for the subscription.

I noticed this when testing an MR where we were adding a new SKU to CustomersDot.  See [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2925#note_526657938) for more info.  This happens quite often as can be seen by these Sentry errors:

- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2446974

- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2465402

- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2069046
- https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2374919

### Proposal

One way to fix this issue would be to update [the `PlansFinder.find` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L49) to fallback to searching Zuora if the product rate plan isn't found within the seat of `eager_loaded_plans`.  Since the product catalog is cached locally anyway, this wouldn't be a very expensive operation as it would have been when this eager loading was originally introduced.

In fact, this eager loading is probably not necessary at all, and we have [an issue to investigate removing it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2680).  While that would be a better longer term solution, this could be a nice, quick short term solution for this problem. If https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2680 get's prioritized first, we can close this issue.

### Result

No more errors like the ones shown above.  We could resolve those in Sentry when this is finished.",2

### Proposal

Fix the schema for Zuora Sandbox.  It looks like the custom field was renamed in Zuora Sandbox but we have to match that in our schema.  If we don't use that field in our codebase, then the better fix might be to remove it from our schema in case it changes again.

### Result

This should fix many errors we're seeing in stg at the moment.

### Next steps (if any)

### Problem
In !2915 a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2915#note_526425953) (+2 comments) about why there is a `#to_param` and `#to_i` being called on a parameter ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4809f88aef0442d6f5e79f6b0b407167ba14d541/app/jobs/expire_order_job.rb#L9)) that is only passed in as an Integer ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4809f88aef0442d6f5e79f6b0b407167ba14d541/app/jobs/expire_order_cron_job.rb#L18)). It turned out that this was recently changed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2303#note_467690097 to meet Sidekiq's best practices. Any remaining jobs during the deploy had to be supported then and therefore this was still needed.

### Proposal
Since there is only one usage where an Integer is being passed in and all jobs the `ExpireOrderJob` class are processed (no retires left as well), we can remove the `#to_param` and `#to_i`. The `#to_i` is also not needed since `.find_by_id` handles this anyway:

```

Order Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  ""orders"".* FROM ""orders"" WHERE ""orders"".""id"" = $1 LIMIT $2  [[""id"", 1], [""LIMIT"", 1]]
[3] pry(main)> Order.find_by_id(nil)
Order Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  ""orders"".* FROM ""orders"" WHERE ""orders"".""id"" IS NULL LIMIT $1  [[""LIMIT"", 1]]
[4] pry(main)> Order.find_by_id("""")
Order Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  ""orders"".* FROM ""orders"" WHERE ""orders"".""id"" = $1 LIMIT $2  [[""id"", nil], [""LIMIT"", 1]]

Order Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  ""orders"".* FROM ""orders"" WHERE ""orders"".""id"" = $1 LIMIT $2  [[""id"", 1], [""LIMIT"", 1]]

Remove unnecessary method calls and therefore clean up the code and avoid possible confusion.",1
80664252,2021-03-10 18:43:04.363,Cloud License: Skip user limit validation when saving cloud licenses,"### Problem

As mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2801, between the time a customer purchases a new SM subscription and the customer activates the license in the SM instance, there is potential for the number of active users in the SM instance to increase.

Currently, when (legacy) licenses are applied to new SM instances (e.g. instances without historical user data), if the instance tries to apply a license for `X` number of users, but the instance has more than `X * 1.1` (where the user overage exceeds 10%), then the license can’t be applied. 10% is the allowed user overage for new/non-renewal subscriptions (defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/25536b04c0c42e250a9d4319eeff7b1d892d47a5/ee/app/models/license.rb#L616)).

This will be a problem for cloud license activation. Let's say a cloud license is purchased for 10 users, but when the customer gets around to activating the license with the code they received in an email, the number active users on their instance is 15. This would exceed the 10% overage allowance and the license would [fail validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/25536b04c0c42e250a9d4319eeff7b1d892d47a5/ee/app/models/license.rb#L619).

### Proposal

The simplest solution to this problem is to skip the user limit validation for cloud licenses and save them regardless of whether the instance is over the user overage allowance for the license. The customer would pay for the increased users at the quarterly reconciliation.  

This also solves the problem for on-going license updates along the lifespan of the cloud license.  Because we will be applying new licenses records during the license sync workflow (even after activation), this will allow the license to be applied even if the license count is lower than the current active user count.",2

80519404,2021-03-09 00:59:59.575,Order total and price not correctly updated after quantity entered,"### Summary

There's a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) occurring in purchase pages (e.g. CI minutes and storage), the problem is happening mostly on our e2e tests but it could happen to our users.

### Proposal

In purchase pages, debounce HTTP requests that are triggered by user input (e.g. change seats count).

Introducing the debounce might increase our bundle size a bit (or a few bytes) but it will prevent the race condition from happening, which help with:

1. Our tests will fail less often
1. Our users won't encounter strange UX behavior in the total price changing unexpectedly

**Note:** since the problem is happening on multiple pages, we want to implement a holistic solution for all pages.

### Details

Here's an example of order total and price not correctly updated after quantity entered:

### Summary

Self-managed instance with a license shows `free` as their `actual_plan` object, instead of the `default` plan object.

### Steps to reproduce

Unknown currently. I'm only aware [that the customer that has been affected](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/196781) (internal link) has had the instance for a very long time (~2+ years).

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Performing any changes to the `default` plan object does not work when raising application limits.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Performing changes to the `default` plan object should work when raising application limits.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

```
irb(main):001:0> project = Project.find_by_full_path(""group/project"")
=> #<Project id:1234 group/project>>
irb(main):002:0> pp project.actual_plan_name
""free""
```

The `free` plan is returned for all projects and groups, newly created, or existing ones. Expected was the `default` plan.

```
irb(main):003:0> pp Gitlab.com? 
false 
```

### Workarounds

(Ways to get around the issue)

Application limits can be updated on the `free` plan object instead of the `default` one.

-->

The following issue was identified during a contracted pentest by the NCC Group. The test was held June 1-11, 2020.

### Problem

There has been a long history of source code disclosure vulnerabilities in web and application servers. Any of these in conjunction with hard-coded secrets in an application’s source could result in their compromise. Additionally, improper server configuration could result in these files being readable by external users. Finally, code is often stored in code repositories with loose access controls, creating another point of potential compromise.

Here is a redacted snippet of hard-coded secrets:
```ruby
request:
    method: post
    uri: https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
    body:
      string: grant_type=password&client_id=[REDACTED]&client_secret=[REDACTED]&u
    sername=[REDACTED]&password=[REDACTED]
    ...
  response:
...
string: '{""access_token"":""<ACCESS_TOKEN>"",""instance_url"":""https://cs63.sale sforce.com"",""id"":""https://test.salesforce.com/id/00D6C0000004d0KUAQ/005610000 024BDwAAM"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""issued_at"":""1589895566673"",""signature"":""[RE DACTED]""}'
```

It appears that these secrets are used mostly in development or staging environments, thus lowering the severity.

The following file locations are affected:
* README.md:78
* README.md:148
* config/secrets.yml.example:59
* db/seeds.rb:18
* spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/Change_namespace_of_existing_subscription/change_group_of_active_subscription/successfully_change_namespace_for_subscription.yml:600
* spec/fixtures/vcr_cassettes/zuora_ee_plan_fetch.yml:88

### Proposal

Sensitive data should not be stored directly in source, but should instead be referenced from configuration files that exist outside of the application’s root. When checking code into a repository, use example files or stubs which are overwritten when the application is deployed.

All secrets that have been checked into the source code repositories should be considered compromised, and changed.

41406838,2020-06-10 19:03:21.031,Graduate Payment Methods page from feature flag,"### Problem

The [`pajamas_payment_methods`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/3/edit) feature flag has been turn on for production for more than 2 months.

I discovered that the style of `.btn-link` class is overriding what it should like in Pajama's design system, and the only place it's being used in is the old payment methods page.


### Proposal

Graduating payment methods from feature flags.

### Steps

- [x] Remove instances of `pajamas_payment_methods`
- [x] Remove old HAML implementation of payment methods pages 
- [x] Remove old HAML specific styles (most notably `.btn-link` in `components.scss`)
- [x] Remove specs that test payment methods pages without feature flag
- [x] Delete `pajamas_payment_methods` feature flag in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags
- [x] Clean up `paymentCallback` in `app/assets/javascripts/payment_methods.js`
- [x] Replace `payment_methods/*` partials with `pajamas/payment_methods/*` 

### Result

Consistent styles with Pajama's and less deprecated code to worry about.

An issue was reported on 2020-06-10 by Sales that a .com customer who had purchased a renewal for a user count less than the currently active user count was inadvertently downgraded to free. 

Based on the investigation, it appears that since the new subscription was for less than the currently active user count, the portal did not know what to do and it caused the namespace to become unlinked from both the previous and new subscription and downgraded them to free. 


### Proposal
Determine the best way to handle this scenario - some options: 

- Allow the namespace to be associated to the new subscription, although they are already over their user count. Co-terms will ultimately capture this lost revenue 
- Charge/invoice the card/customer for the difference 
- Provide some kind of messaging to the Salesperson associated with the renewal so they can take action 


### Result
Happy customers, less errors

### Summary

When customer add more users in subscription in customer portal, a new license is generated. Customer portal will generate a working license the for the updated license. However, if customer add more users later on during the same license period, all the new license will have the `Previous users count` of the `Users count` at the beginning of license term and `True-up` of the first Add more users of the license.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Purchase License term: 2020-05-01 - 2021-05-01 and upload to the system. 
    - Users count originally purchase: `50`


2. Add more user `7` to the license for the first time 2020-05-30 and upload to the system:
   - New Users count: `57`
   - Previous users count: `50`
   - True-up: `7` 


3. Add more user `10` to the license for the second time 2020-06-02 and upload to the system:
   - New `Users count`: `67`
   - Previous users count: `50`
   - True-up: `7`


4. Add more user `20` to the license for the third time 2020-06-05 and upload to the system:
   - New `Users count`: `87`
   - Previous users count: `50`
   - True-up: `7`

This would cause error when uploading `#3` and `#4` because they are not referencing the license currently on the system.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

New license after adding more users to license multiple time keep referencing the license at the beginning of the license term.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Add more users to license multiple time should correctly referencing the latest license on the system.

### Workarounds

Manually generate a working license

34531770,2020-05-14 02:14:30.750,BE: Allow users to manually renew subscription up to 30 days post expiration,"## Summary

When the subscription expiration date is reached, we remove purchase event buttons (upgrade, add-on, renew, autorenew) from the subscription card. We specifically removed the `Renew` button because the system wasn't processing the renewal properly upon selection. 

## Proposal
As per the Sales/Finance [policy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/1653#note_422409896) of updating customer subscriptions to cancelled and closing the respective Renewal opportunity 30 days after subscription term end date, we should allow the customer to renew their expired subscription within customers.gitlab.com with a 30 day grace period as well.

## Success Criteria

1. This applies to both GitLab.com and Self-Managed subscriptions
1. This change does not extend the paid entitlement (SM license/GitLab.com paid features), nor the period in which the customer is entitled to paid support 
1. In customers.gitlab.com, when the expiration date is reached, all action buttons (upgrade, add seats, autorenew) should be removed except `Renew`
1. The user should be able to select the `Renew` button for a period of 30 days post the expiration date
1. Customers.gitlab.com should present the standard Renewal purchase flow to the customer and accept payment during checkout
     1. If payment fails, the transaction should not be processed and no change should be sent to Zuora
     1. If payment is successful, customers.gitlab.com should send a renewal amendment to Zuora with the subscription details

## Testing & Availability
1. `Renew` button is available on CustomersDot manage plan page if plan's expiration date is within last 30 days
1. For SaaS user, `Renew` button is also available on personal/group billing page
1. Hide `renew` button if the subscription expired more than 30 days ago
1. Upon clicking `renew` button, user enters the normal upgrade + renew flow.

34525639,2020-05-13 20:29:23.110,Add GitLab::Database::MigrationHelpers to Customers Portal,"### Problem
In the GitLab codebase, it is recommended to use [database helpers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/44d881b91a0ed366a7aec019481840da001cbf5c/lib/gitlab/database/migration_helpers.rb) like `add_column_with_defaults`.  In the Customers portal code, we have some database helpers [defined here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d08fb068c42c73a857947302c26863020db74edc/lib/database/migrations_helper.rb) but it's not the full set of helpers like GitLab.

### Proposal
The ideal solution would be to move these database helpers in GitLab to a library or gem so it can be easily shared and updated in other applications like Customers.  The easier but less elegant solution could be to simply copy the library over to Customers.

### Result
Access to more migration helpers making migrations safer and follow standards recommended in the development docs.

-------

@vshumilo added:

**First...**

There had to make the choice between copying `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers` and its tests
to the customers app or creating a gem.
After a short analysis it was decided to move with the easiest (less time consuming) approach
of copying the file because:
- It solved the immediate need to have the migration helpers available
- It was less time consuming as it required much less process (we had a time budget in mind)
- Creating the gem then required Gitlab to be updated to reference and use it as part of the same
issue otherwise those logics will diverge (again, we had a time budget in mind)
- Gitlab migration helpers are quite tangled with other modules, lasses and helpers which added challenge to extract all that code
- :keycap_asterisk: There is already at attempt to [move the helpers into a gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/27307/diffs) in progress so feels like doubling a lot of effors 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Then...**

The original intention of moving the entire `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers`
resulted to be an effort bigger than the budget in time and the needs we present at the moment.
- A lot of the helpers at the `Gitlab` end are very specific. Ex: `backfill_iids`
- A lot of the helpers at the `Gitlab` end rely on other modules that need to be moved along if we want to move the helpers

As a result [a half way migration of the helpers into costumers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1433) was resulting in ~4000 new lines of code and a lot of work pending related to fixing the specs by copying the missing dependencies, updating references (some other magnitud of thousands lines). 

This ""size"" overflows the current appetite for this change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Now...**

As a result the agreement was to pick 10 methods and move them along as a first iteration.

:exclamation: Try to make sure the methods we pick are methods we might end up needing.

This is a list of the current methods on the Gitlab end and highlighten are
those that count with a counterpart on our end created by copying and adjusting the
original method's logic:

I will take on the quest to action on 10 more.

Resulting:

**Existing Methods:**

- def add_concurrent_foreign_key(source, target, column:, on_delete: :cascade)
- def foreign_key_exists?(source, target = nil, column: nil)
- def concurrent_foreign_key_name(table, column)
- def disable_statement_timeout
- def remove_foreign_key_without_error(*args)
- def add_concurrent_index(table_name, column_name, options = {})
- def remove_concurrent_index(table_name, column_name, options = {})

#### **New Additions:**
- :white_check_mark: def add_timestamps_with_timezone
- :white_check_mark: def remove_timestamps
- :x: def index_exists_by_name? **DEPRECATED** :lion_face:

### References
:lion_face: `remove_concurrent_index_by_name` within `Gitlab::Database::MigrationHelpers` is using a [custom implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/database/migration_helpers.rb#L1084) to check if an index exists by name for the provided table.
It is and old implementation and was based on the lack of Rails support to check this AND had a note to be updated as soon as the app was upgraded to Rails > 5.1.7 which introduces [index_name_exists?](https://apidock.com/rails/v5.2.3/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/SchemaStatements/index_name_exists%3F)

Created a [tech-debt issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219285) in the Gitlab context as a reminder so this can be updated on that end too.

34471257,2020-05-12 20:23:24.017,No Portal access for customers in reseller deals,"### Problem
In #1169, we've identified new workflows necessary to better facilitate reseller deals.  However, those new workflows, like allowing resellers access to the Customers Portal, could have big implications for the app and implementing those features could take significant effort.

### Proposal
As an MVC, we want to block all users from reseller deals from gaining access to the Customers Portal.  The Customers Portal should still create Customer records, necessary for keep existing features working like subscription creation and license management, but simply do not allow those Customers to sign in.  In addition, these Customers should not receive welcome emails from the Portal.  They should however, still receive emails for EULA acceptance and license delivery.

### Result
The end user in reseller deals can't login to the Customers Portal for reseller deals.

Basically anything that refers to the plan could be shared.  It's a minor point as this way works too, but it would be more efficient to avoid the call to Zuora.

We've adopted `gl-new-button` (named `gl-button`) which follows the Pajamas style guide.

*  [Related Sales Systems Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/645)
*  The portal has a bug in it where it may potentially update an opportunity that was closed in a previous month and then closing it in the current month.

*  Once an Opportunity is closed (Won/Lost) in a previous month it should never be changed or reopened and closed

For notifying changes and requesting a review from business stakeholders, at the moment we have checklists in the MRs such as:

* [ ] Ping `@jbrennan1` for review if the issue has the ~""Affects Salesforce"" label
* [ ] Ping `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` for review if the MR involves Zuora business logic

While we have other reviews such as backend, frontend (review + maintainer review) and Database reviews all in Danger, where it makes it more difficult to miss.

### Proposal

We could automate this perhaps based on monitoring files/namespaces and incorporate it to Danger so this is no longer easily missed.

We should make sure this process is lightweight enough so it doesn't impact delivery times. For example, this may mean that we could get up to **7 different reviews** per MR (initial review, maintainer review, database review, database maintainer review, security review, EntApps review, Sales review)",2

33216710,2020-04-13 14:38:37.842,Clarify params used for gitlab_support_url helper method,"The following discussion from !1169 should be addressed:

- [ ] @oswaldo started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1169#note_322136203):  (+1 comment)

    > I'm not sure if I follow this number, should that be extracted to some constant, or YAML config?

## Problem
Currently, [the `gitlab_support_url` helper method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/dbb3aa0a13505f6514b43bd43b23f2a1379c9de1/app/helpers/application_helper.rb#L24) accepts an optional param for `ticket_form_id`.  This is used throughout the views with param values like `360000071293` and `334447`.  It's not clear what these values mean.

## Proposal
Instead of using these numbers directly when calling the helper method, it would be preferable to set these as constants or set them in application.yml.  Referencing them in one place will make it easier to update in the future and make it clearer when seeing the reference in code.  For example, this `gitlab_support_url(LICENSING_AND_RENEWAL_PROBLEMS)` is clearer than `gitlab_support_url(360000071293)`.",1

### Problem

Page `Account details` was migrated to Pajamas styles but not to Vue.js components.

What do we have on it:

4 separated sections (all screenshots were taken from Pajamas version):

<details>
<summary>Personal details</summary>
![image](/uploads/e0f5c1cb7982394deb31194726c9d143/image.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Link GitLab account</summary>
![image](/uploads/d93515fe274ef1717e60cf69cab700f5/image.png)
</details>

### Proposal

In order to complete our Pajamas update, we should update this page too. 
We already have a feature flag for that page - `pajamas_account_page` so I suggest the following plan:

* We implement a Vue.js component for each section without integrating it.

### Result

Vue.js based page for account details with more control over extensibility (VAT field visibility depends on selected country). Removed legacy `select2` selects for country and state.

### Next steps (if any)

The 4 new components:

* [x] `Personal Details`
* [x] `Company Details`
* [x] `Change Password`
* [x] `Link GitLab Account`

All have been merged now, and they are behind feature flags.

* [x] Integrate all these components to a Vue.js app 

* Move information about linked GitLab account to `CustomerPresenter`.
* Replace all 4 Vue.js applications with a single Vue.js app.
* Optional: Show all errors in the root Vue.js application for better UX (or keep them for now in their components but just scroll to an errored component and expand it).

* [ ] Enable all 4 flags in production

![edit_cc_default_box](/uploads/8dd82e68600f9a37d11f88ce24ec9103/edit_cc_default_box.png)

Having no default payment method results in the following error message when the customer tries to make a payment:

* I am using the latest Chrome on Mac and the screen was 100% without any scroll.
* It works normally when using a private window
* And same result as before (no button) outside of incognito mode

I did some digging because I was curious:
1) The button is there, just not visible because of the height of the surrounding iframe (no scrollbar)
2) If I manually increase the height of the iframe to 412px (the height in the incognito mode), the button appears

So weirdly enough, the iframe is not correctly sized outside of incognito mode.

### Problem

Discovered during: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1166#note_302990067

> When `pajamas_login_register` feature flag is off and the user gets redirected to `customers/sign_up` to fill in the rest of the details, the form is being populated by the user's information the user already filled in GitLab.

Filling in the same information is extra work for the user, and runs the risk of mismatched information.

### Proposal

Ensure prefill of form when being redirected from `gitlab.com/users/sign_in` 

### Result

Less work for users signing up.

### Problem- 

There used to be an view invoice tab in the account details option at the customers.gitlab.com. This helped sales team to understand the payment methods used for past purchases and the entire purchase history of customers. Many times when a customer want to change the card associated with account, they reach to sales team. Sales re needs to find the card associated, this option used to help in finding the card used for past purchases.

Additionally, self- serving customers also could download the invoice from there and use it for filing reimbursement.

- [ ] @vitallium started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1746#note_406076340):  (+4 comments)

    > @tyleramos, continuing our discussion here because I renamed the class `ZuoraIntegration` to `ZuoraTimeTraveller`. `ZuoraIntegration` was a bad name.
    > 
    > So. I think it's fine to use original datetime for VCR in `new_episodes` mode. And we do the same for `once` and `none` modes. For `all` we use the current datetime.

## Problem

With the new `ZuoraTimeTraveler` class, we will make the specs that use VCR and Zuora less flakey by using Timecop to freeze time using the datetime from the VCR cassette recording.  This approach however makes the record mode `:new_episodes` unusable because the entire cassette must be created at one time.

## Proposal

Raise an error if `:new_episodes` is used with a message of why it can't be used.  It's possible that it could be used for a subset of specs as long as those specs don't use the `:zuora` rspec metadata tag ([introduced here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1746)).  Not sure if it's possible or worth it to make that distinction.",1

### Steps to reproduce

1. Checkout the latest master/staging of customer portal https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com

`bundle exec rake db:setup` should create the database if it doesn't exist.

70591748,2020-09-01 17:06:50.220,Patch the IronBank gem to make error codes more accessible,"The following discussion from !1856 should be addressed:

- [ ] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1856#note_405535241):  (+1 comment)

    > It's disappointing that IronBank doesn't make the codes easily accessible, forcing us to search for the code in this way.  :slight_frown:
    > 
    > This totally works though and I'm fine with it in the short term.  What do you think about opening a follow-up issue to patch IronBank to make these codes easily accessible by adding an instance method to [the error class](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/error.rb)?  I've submitted a PR to that repo before and the maintainers seems to be very responsive.  It's not something we have to act on immediately but might be nice to work on it at some point in the future.  Thoughts?

## Problem

We can't directly access error codes for an `IronBank::Error` as [discussed here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1856#note_405535241).  It's contained inside the message of the error object which contains an unparsed json string.  This makes for a less-than-elegant solution when determining the exact error class returned from Zuora.

## Proposal

Submit a PR to the IronBank repo to make an `error_code` instance method available on [the Error class](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/blob/main/lib/iron_bank/error.rb).  Once this is accepted and the gem is updated, we can use this updated gem in the portal, replacing the [code here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1856/diffs#52d3703e65dee7027b3ef5af4fd34791dfe83d1c_19_16) with something a bit more concrete (e.g. `Zuora::ErrorCodes.rescuable_codes.include?(e.error_code)`).",2

The flag was simply created in order to more easily time the roll out in conjunction with the new EULA process.  I think once the flag has been enabled for a day or so it should be safe to remove.

This should be done after the work for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1879 is completed.

### Problem
Subscriptions that are linked to deleted GitLab groups/namespaces cause errors in the Customers Portal due to the a fetch request to GitLab for that group/namespace.

### Proposal
With the work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1879 this scenario is being prevented. So after the work for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1879  is completed, the existing inconsistencies because of that problem should be resolved. 

These are two possible solutions:
- update existing subscriptions that are linked to deleted groups/namespaces to set the attributes `gl_namespace_id` and `gl_namespace_name` to nil
- make Customers Portal's code fail-safe by not trying to fetch data when the group/namespace can't be found (e.g. in `GitLab::Namespace::UpdatePlanInfoService` which gets called on namespace change)

### Result
No errors due to inconsistencies that were caused by subscriptions linked to deleted groups/namespaces.

### Next steps (if any)


### How will we measure success?

### Problem
The deletion of groups/namespaces with linked subscriptions are creating inconsistencies between GitLab and the Customers Portal. The linked group/namespace can't be fetched on the Customers Portal side on update like changing namespace and results in an error (500).

### Proposal
Prevent groups/namespaces from being deleted when they have a subscription. A group/namespace has to be disassociated from any linked subscriptions before deletion.

It should also be checked what happens to a subscription when a group gets transferred. The current assumption is that the subscription does not change.

### Design

[See UX issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1923)

### Result
Keep data between GitLab and Customers portal in sync.

### Next steps (if any)
- Disable the `Delete group` button when deleting a group
- Add an info text about disassociating any subscriptions first
- Prevent deletion in the backend

70327080,2020-08-26 14:54:54.129,Cap percentageUsed at 0% and on 100% if return value is out of range,"### Problem

With the following data:

| now          | start date   | end date     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `2018-04-02` | `2018-05-02` | `2019-05-02` |


The percentage used should be: `0%`, but the current implementation is returning `-8%`

With the following data:

| now          | start date   | end date     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| `2020-04-02` | `2018-05-02` | `2019-05-02` |

The percentage used should be: `100%`, but the current implementation will return something like `240%`

### How to reproduce

Renew a subscription 2+ times then go to ""add more seats"" page (the pajama's page) and see the percentage.

Example of the issue:

### Proposal

We need to cap `percentageUsed` to:

- `0%` if the `start date` is in the future.
- `100%` if the `end date` is in the past.

### Result

We will have realistic percentages and we can unblock shipping #1808.

This is the issue for the ~backend part.

### Problem
A user should be able to self-serve upgrade a paid self-managed subscription to a higher tier.

### Proposal
This workflow already exists for upgrading a .com subscription, so try reusing that logic as much as possible.

When upgrading an existing paid self-managed subscription to a higher tier:
* Prorate total price at the new rate for the remaining time, e.g. when upgrading a Starter subscription bought 4 months ago, only pay for the remaining 8 months for the new tier
* Create amendment with the same end date as the original subscription (syncs to Zuora)
* Generate new license key
* Send new license key to user
* Deprecate old license key
* Make sure this process works if it was triggered from Zuora directly instead of the Customers Portal (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/353#note_120015198)",3
70288817,2020-08-25 21:37:56.356,Clarify that the customers portal is a separate platform,"### Problem

When GitLab.com users purchase products or go to manage their subscription from within GitLab.com, they often don't realize that they were taken to a separate website. 
- Users are often confused by ""Sign in with GitLab"" because they believe they are still on GitLab.com and are already signed it. 
- For first time users, the customers portal registration step is confusing because users have trouble understanding why they are being asked to register again (not realizing they are on a separate website).

The root of these issues comes down to the fact that users don't notice that they are being sent to a separate website when they are redirected to the customers portal.

### Proposal

Our long term vision is to move all purchasing/subscription management out of the portal and into GitLab.com for SaaS customers. 

But in the short term, we can make the customers portal a better experience by being clearer about the fact that it is a website separate from GitLab.com and telling the user why that is.

### Design

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hFQB3yZJTD7ZZlBNBNH2hw/Clarify-that-the-customers-portal-is-a-separate-platform?node-id=0%3A1)

**Important:** The implemented designs differ from the Figma designs and the designs attached as a result of some discussions. To iterate faster we decided not to modify the Figma file nor the attached designs. Here are the differences:
- Main h1 heading sits on its own row, just like in theGitLab signup page ([relevant discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1865#note_416996380))
- Typography is the same as GitLab.com signup page; only notable exception is the paragraph, which will have the Pajamas h2 styles ([relevant discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1865#note_417714030))
- The text in the paragraph changes to `The Customers Portal is a standalone site for managing payment and license information` ([relevant discussion here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1984#note_420799169))

### Validation Issue

This line has the validation which is causing the error: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/app/services/gitlab/namespace/update_plan_info_service.rb#L30

> raise(::Errors::ActionNotAllowed, ""Namespace change to #{order_gl_namespace_id} is not allowed"") unless namespace_transaction_validator.valid?

According to the description in the [relevant commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/commit/a51b25ca85662460bb2d00f8592728aea7b4c125), this validation was added for this reason:

> Please note that subscriptions with add-ons can
only be moved when the new namespace does not have a subscription yet,
also subscriptions containing legacy CI minutes only are not moveable.

However, we're seeing orders with the `amendment_type: ""UpdateProduct""` where there are no add-ons and we cannot force associate the order.

### Current workaround

Our workaround right now is to change the `amendment_type` temporarily and change it back after we run the function.

### Ask

I'd like to know what Support can do here. I'd really prefer not to be messing around with the order data to make our function work but we also need this function to work, especially when there are no add-ons attached.

1. Why are we hitting this validation error for orders that don't have add-ons?
1. In the short term, the workaround is to force the sync anyway. Is it a problem if there are add-ons?

70036930,2020-08-19 20:52:47.304,Stop sending EULA requests for new purchases,"### Problem
As mentioned in [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4225), we no longer require the manual EULA process.  In order to move away from this process, we must stop the generation of new EULA requests.

### Proposal

Update the `ZuoraCallbacksController` to remove references to EULAs.  This means we will no longer send a EULA Request email to the customer and will send the license key directly to the customer instead (for EE plans).

We should also be able to remove [the EULA question in the SKU Issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/938c94efbaaf6cbd50acd6b6d6ed87ceba7e7c03/.gitlab/issue_templates/Sku.md#L26), as this is no longer relevant.

70030194,2020-08-19 16:52:51.201,Updating company VAT number field fails to save,"## UPDATE 2020-09-23

1. This failure occurs when no customer record exists in Zuora
1. The customer record does not exist because no purchase has been made

### Actions

1. Remove the VAT from Account Details page if no Customer exists in Zuora - work for this issue
1. Introduce VAT on all purchase flows for applicable countries #2022 
1. Prefill VAT where available from Zuora and allow customer to overwrite #2023 



---

## Summary

Entering a VAT number under **account details** > **your company details** >> **VAT Number** returns a `Your account has been updated successfully.` message, but the VAT Number input box remains empty. Sounds like it updates the VAT internally, but continues to show an empty field to the customer, causing confusion.

### Steps to reproduce

Set your Country location under Personal Details to any country that would have a VAT number (primarily those within the EU) in order for the VAT number box to appear under company details. Enter a valid VAT number and save the form.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Customer portal does not show updated VAT number

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

VAT should be updated and the input box should reflect the change

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

No sentry errors that I can find.

Form data looks correct; POST 302s

69993917,2020-08-19 07:30:28.220,Error when calling namespace change for customer's subscription who does not have a linked GitLab account,"### Summary

While conducting some testing for another issue with @vshumilo, we found a 500 error. It happens when clicking the button to `change linked namespace` of a subscription that was created manually in Zuora (sales-assisted purchase) for a customer that has not linked their account to GitLab yet. This results in a `nil` object [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/views/subscriptions/_edit_gitlab_com_plan.html.haml#L7).

### Steps to reproduce

- Have a customer account that has not linked their account to GitLab
- Create a subscription in Zuora for that customer
- Look for subscription in the Customers Portal and click `change linked namespace` for it
- See error

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

A 500 error is raised when clicking on the `change linked namespace` button or calling its page directly via url.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Page for change linked namespace is successfully rendered.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)

### Workarounds

None

### Possible solutions

Add safe nav (`&`) to the line that raised the error ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/views/subscriptions/_edit_gitlab_com_plan.html.haml#L7)).

**But a cleaner overall solution would be:**
Always return an array for the [`GitLab::Namespace::ListService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/namespace/list_service.rb) which is used in the a lot of helper methods in [`GitLabPlansHelper`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/helpers/gitlab_plans_helper.rb) with a safe nav (`&`). Although it has to be checked if this affects anything else if an empty Array is returned instead of `nil`.


### Reported examples

Environment: Staging 
Pre conditions: [`reconciliations` feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags) is enabled

### Steps to reproduce

For any .com subscription that has enabled the `Change linked namespace` action.

1. Check the Subscription quantity.
1. Try linking the subscription to another namespace OR group that has the same quantity via ""Change linked namespace"" action.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The initial selection of such namespace will result on a `422 (Unprocessable Entity)`

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

We should be able to updated the linked namespace for a subscription when the conditions for such a change [are valid](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9157567e4f93a4ba9a3412e9aaa849a97c1f37ac/doc/subscription_namespace_change.md) not affected by the quantity.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

The issue seems to be related to the `AmendSubscriptionService`.

The `AmendSubscriptionService` will [error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b769f1a499cc793a674462f092734d00429201bd/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L17) if it is not able to generate and amendment for the requested action.

The issue seems related to [this check](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9157567e4f93a4ba9a3412e9aaa849a97c1f37ac/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L42) for when:

- The quantities match
- The subscription is not autorenew and there is not an increase in quantity.

In the context of the Subscription Portal, we want to move Zuora interactions to jobs whenever asynchronous execution is a possibility.

### Proposal
Move the logic that executes on `ZuoraCallbacksController#subscription_update` to a job.

### Result
Whenever a callout happens from Zuora regarding a subscription update: Amendments, New Subscriptions, Refunds.
Instead of executing the `subscription_update` logic inline we will enqueue a Job that will take care of the further required:
- Zuora queries
- Gitlab sync

- We expect to see more successful codes in the Zuora Notification Callout History (meaning the Jobs have been enqueued on our end)

### Problem
As a potential (or past) Gold customer I might want to change the namespace of a subscription to a group on Free. If any Guest users are present, the customers application will bill me for the number of seats in `billable_users` regardless of the _target_ subscription level. In the case of Gold, Guest users should _not_ be charged.

Reproduction is hard because you need an existing subscription. 

#### What works

The following flow _works as expected_ on a new purchase from the billing page:
- Create a new (free) group.
- Add a guest user
- Attempt a purchase of Gold, and note it will charge for the correct number of users.

#### What doesn't work
Attempting to change the namespace of an _existing_ subscription to a Free group does _not_ work correctly.


### Proposal
Build the list of billable users based on the target subscription level, rather than the current subscription level. Mirror the logic in the new purchase flow.

### Workaround
Re-establishing a Gold trial restores the billable users count to what it should be and allows the subscription to be applied.",5

62129687,2020-07-16 22:17:36.664,Introduce matching web direct data on domain to avoid duplicate accounts in SFDC,"### Problem

The **initial** Web-Direct order from the portal does not attempt to match against an existing Salesforce account, and instead **always** creates a net-new account (sometimes a duplicate, sometimes not). This is problematic primarily in scenarios where we've:

1. Have existing `Sales-Assisted` accounts/hierarchies in place, as the closed won business now is duplicated somewhere else.
1. Have existing ""greenfield"" accounts already built out in Salesforce.

In both examples we're now creating duplicate accounts, as well as potentially breaking `new` vs `connected new` business metrics - as these web direct accounts aren't tied to existing Acct Hierarchies in Salesforce.

The subsequent renewal web direct order already has the Account ID, and therefore pushes to the existing Account it already created, **unless possibly** it was merged on Salesforce side already as a dupe (would need to validate this example).

In a perfect world the portal would attempt to first do some sort of matching logic to find an existing account in Salesforce prior to generating a new one. Examples of what I've seen in other applications would be a search on:

1. `Domain/Website` Match
1. `Company Name` Match
1. Combinations of fuzzy `Company Name`, `Domain`, `Address` matches (probably more complicated)

### Problem

Whenever a user navigates to a **new subscription** page to make a purchase (for a subscription, plan or add-on), we [store that url in the session](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a9a49f5d71154ca43ddf3e7130c853f5ade31d72/app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb#L204-206) so we can use it to redirect the customer after they confirm their email. 

This url usually looks like `https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=0000&transaction=XXXX` but could also be a named one like `https://customers.gitlab.com/buy_pipeline_minutes` or `https://customers.gitlab.com/buy_storage`.

In !1646 we started using this `session[:visited_plan]` value to redirect the user [after signing in](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f684885c4e146281d8a810977bc88f2db0a61106/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L173). This ensures that the user goes back to the subscription page they were looking at before being prompted to sign in or register (if they weren't already signed in).

However, this `:visited_plan` value **can stick around after the user has logged out** because it's not in the `devise` namespace. This could result in the user being redirected to a previously visited plan page right after logging in. In a scenario where they come from the *Sign In* page and not from a subscription page, this would not be the expected behavior.

**Example Scenario**
1. User goes to Customer Portal without signing in
1. User clicks on _Buy CI Minutes_
1. User is prompted to connect with Gitlab
1. User is redirected to _Buy more CI minutes_ form
1. They complete the purchase
1. User can now go and manage their subscription
1. User logs out
1. User goes signs in again from the sign in form (`/customers/sign_in`)
1. They are redirected to _Buy more CI minutes_ because the `visited_plan` value is still in the session
1. They *should* have been redirected to manage their subscriptions 

**Notes**

:exclamation: This will happen only if the user signs in *again* before the [session expires](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f684885c4e146281d8a810977bc88f2db0a61106/config/initializers/session_store.rb#L11). 

:exclamation: If the user logs out and comes back to log in again after that time has passed, they will be redirected to manage their subscriptions.

:exclamation: This is more evident when testing in development or staging where we may need to do something with one test user, visit a plan purchase page and then log in with a different account to do something else. 

### Proposal

Consider scoping `:visited_plan` to the Devise session (`session[""devise.visited_plan""]`) so the value gets automatically cleaned up by Devise whenever a new session is created.

### Result

`session[""devise.visited_plan""]` is reset with every new session.

### Problem

We use `GitlabPlansHelper` every time we want to pull Gitlab namespaces for a customer:

* To fill a select with available namespaces when purchasing a new subscription;
* To fill a select with all namespaces when a customer wants to change linked namespace;

We are slowly transitioning to Vue.js and using this helper becomes harder because we need more data in a slightly different form. For instance, we want to see if a returned namespace has an expired subscription.

### Proposal

I suggest to deprecate this helper and add a new attribute called `subscription` to the existing `namespace` object.

**Current `namespace` object structure:**

```
                                    ""id"" => 53,
                                  ""name"" => ""gold"",
                                  ""path"" => ""gold"",
                                  ""kind"" => ""group"",
                             ""full_path"" => ""gold"",
                             ""parent_id"" => nil,
                            ""avatar_url"" => nil,
                               ""web_url"" => ""http://127.0.0.1:3000/groups/gold"",
        ""members_count_with_descendants"" => 1,
                ""billable_members_count"" => 1,
                                  ""plan"" => ""silver"",
                         ""trial_ends_on"" => nil,
                                 ""trial"" => false,
```

**Suggested `namespace` object structure:**

```
                                    ""id"" => 53,
                                  ""name"" => ""gold"",
                                  ""path"" => ""gold"",
                                  ""kind"" => ""group"",
                             ""full_path"" => ""gold"",
                             ""parent_id"" => nil,
                            ""avatar_url"" => nil,
                               ""web_url"" => ""http://127.0.0.1:3000/groups/gold"",
        ""members_count_with_descendants"" => 1,
                ""billable_members_count"" => 1,
                                  ""plan"" => ""silver"",
                         ""trial_ends_on"" => nil, // deprecate this field also and move it under subscription attribute
                                 ""trial"" => false, // deprecate this field also and move it under subscription attribute
                          ""subscription"" => {
                     ""name"" => ""A-S00039218"",
               ""start_date"" => Tue, 30 Jun 2020,
                 ""end_date"" => Wed, 30 Jun 2021,
            ""trial_active"" => false
        }
```

**NOTE:** I do not suggest removing it completely because we have the code that depends on this helper but stop adding new functionality to it.

### Result

* Removed legacy helper with better-structured data.
* Removed code that is hard to maintain due to its growing complexity.

### Problem

When users get redirected to `Sign In with GitLab` and end in the registration page, the form contains the password field as a required field to complete the process.

However, if the user is signing in with GitLab they shouldn't be asked to provide a password.

### Proposal

Only render the password field if the user trying to register has empty `provider` and `uid` fields. The way it's done in  [app/views/shared/customer/_sign_up_form.html.haml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/views/shared/customer/_sign_up_form.html.haml#L2). 

Relevant thread: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1484#note_371285508

### Result

The customer will be required to provide only the missing information in the registration form. 

After #1176 is addressed, customers will only need to provide their billing info (city, zip code, country) to complete the registration.

### Next steps (if any)

:warning: Removing this as a next step because users can add a password after signing in with GitLab via the `Forgot Password` form and they'll need a way to update it from their Account Details page.

~~Update the `Account Details` page so that the `Update Password` section is not displayed for users that register from `Sign In with GitLab`.~~

Since the Customer Portal has much the same dependencies as GitLab does, we can piggyback on the [gitlab-build-image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-build-images ) from there.

This should result in faster builds, and more reliable installs of headless chrome, so we do not end up [with these sort of workarounds again](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1423)",2

53910741,2020-07-04 11:51:52.943,N+1 query on loading the subscriptions list,"### Problem

Our `SubscriptionPresenter` produces too many extra queries when we call it. The presenter returns the state of EULA request by querying the `eula_requests` table.
The simplest fix would be including this table (`eula_requests`) to the list of subscriptions but the `Subscription` model is not the `ActiveRecord` class. We can't use `include` on it. We should find another way of preloading `eula_requests` for the given list of subscriptions.

53812606,2020-07-02 21:20:44.936,Add ability for admin to renew trial,"### Problem

From #1173 

The extend trial feature was implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/372 but our team members have not seen this option on any expired trials.

Note: the option to extend trials by changing the end date does appear for active trials.

### Example

The group https://gitlab.com/groups/this-trial-wont-work/-/billings has a trial that expired 2019-06-13, but there's no options that I can see that would allow me to:

1. Know that a trial existed but has since expired
1. Extend that trial

Screenshot: ![image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/bd6d2401597df0a913801d2d7b776bfd/image.png)

Interestingly, even though Lyle started a new trial

```
#<Order:0x000000000bfbfb48
 id: 56044,
 customer_id: 8334,
 product_rate_plan_id: ""2c92a0fc5a83f01d015aa6db83c45aac"",

 subscription_name: nil,
 start_date: Tue, 11 Feb 2020,
 end_date: Wed, 12 Feb 2020,
 quantity: 1,
 created_at: Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:55:46 UTC +00:00,
 updated_at: Tue, 11 Feb 2020 00:56:24 UTC +00:00,
 gl_namespace_id: ""7139776"",

 amendment_type: nil,
 trial: true,
 last_extra_ci_minutes_sync_at: nil,
 zuora_account_id: nil,
 increased_billing_rate_notified_at: nil>
```

The expired date is still the original. Nevertheless, I'm certain that more than one of Lyle's groups have had trials and none of them are showing previous expiration dates or the option to extend: https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/8334/list_gitlab_namespaces

Please see @lyle's comments for more details: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/372#note_284557673

## This issue will be resolved when

Note: displaying the date of a previously expired trial is being worked on in #1173 

When team members have the ability to: 

* Reactivate and extend expired trials
  * A team member will select a ""renew trial"" button
  * The button will automatically reactivate the trial with Gold plan and an end date 2 weeks from current date
  * Once reactivated, team member can select different plan and end date as with any active trial
  * Note: team members should be able to reactive any trial regardless of its age

## Technical considerations

As noted in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1576#note_380200751

would be much easier to implement if we know which orders were created as a trial originally, and being able to check if a `trial` is `true` would help validate not accidentally changing a non-trial order.

From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1643#note_372870393

finding the original order for the trial may be somewhat problematic because the `trial_histories` table doesn't include the order ID.

Ideally, when [the trial expires](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/6b275192c6dfa91f2ddee9ed7d50480fba34b65d/app/jobs/expire_order_job.rb#L17-23), the data is not edited so that the order keeps the original end date and that it was tied to a trial.

Nevertheless, even in the current state of things, we could potentially use the fact that trials are the only type of order not tied to a purchase transaction to find the relevant order:

```
subscription_id: nil,
 subscription_name: nil
```

The function could be a modified version of [what support currently use via console](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/console-training-wheels/-/blob/master/lib/support_team.rb#L7), specifying gold plan and the current date + 2 weeks for the trial end date, as long as we also add the validation above.
 
### Potential Solution

* Add 'order_id' to trials history table

### Problem

The Data team needs to be able to replicate the GitLab UI Billing/Usage values that Customers/Users see on the GitLab UI into internal reports (for Sales, Product, etc) from the data warehouse. To ensure one SSOT for these calculations, it would be ideal that these values are stored in the same location at the same data granularity. 

This issue specifically tracks storing the `seats_currently_in_use` field in gitlab.com `subscription` table. I will leave it up to the person who picks up this ticket to decide if this issue should also track making the UI read and use this value or if that should be a separate issue. Thank you for your help! 

FYI @amandarueda , @jbrennan1 , @derekatwood , @jeromezng 

### Proposal


Currently, the `max_seats_used` is stored into the `gitlab_subscriptions` table [via this cron job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/c086bd8f75537a7f73fc386f2053962b389dc990/ee/app/workers/update_max_seats_used_for_gitlab_com_subscriptions_worker.rb). It would be ideal if this cron job also stored the other values on the [billing page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/5084/designs/Screen_Shot_2020-06-15_at_5.07.01_PM.png) into the datawarehouse at the same time and that the UI was retrieving this value so that there can be more consistency across systems in terms of our internal and external reporting of this value.

### Problem

Some background: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1581#note_372289528

In our `/plans` page we've got product specific copy; for example ""1000 CI minutes"".

We've also got product specific copy living on the frontend in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/products.js

Additionally there's quite a lot of copy that's living in HAML templates or Vue templates.

This means that updating copy can mean touching multiple different files, and that copy can get out of sync.

### Proposal

We should decide on some guidelines on when a copy should be pulled to a central place, and when it's fine to have it live in templates.

* When should copy be pulled to a presenter (worth taking inspiration from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/blob/master/app/presenters/README.md#when-to-use-a-presenter)
* When should copy live in the Vue template?
* When should we pull data directly from Zuora?
* Should some of this live in a database so we do not need to run a deploy to update copy?",1

Somehow, customer records which have at least one credit card on file have gotten into a state where there is no default credit card indicated. This causes a purchasing error for users.

We should query for all customer records which have:

1. an active subscription
1. no default payment method
1. autorenew set to true

50130977,2020-06-26 14:39:48.548,UX: How should we display pricing information related to purchases?,"## Summary

While working [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1560), we discovered a use case (plan upgrades) which we determined needed an additional level of pricing detail (the proration credit) that we do not currently display. 

In following this discussion, we determined that we would likely need to mimic the line-level detail on invoices in the subscription card to adequately display the activity. 

This led me to wonder why we are displaying pricing in the subscription card at all? I am not sure this data is commonly used by customers, especially since it is incorrect today and we don't get complaints about it. 

Perhaps we should spend effort on making the Invoices page more useful (collated by subscription, provide an ability to expand and view details, etc), rather than building pricing out in the subscription card.

I'd like UX to dig into this and provide a recommendation. Since we've removed the pricing from the subscription card, I'd like to get this follow-on work in pretty quickly.",2

50030430,2020-06-24 13:30:23.081,Consider using IronBank's local records feature to improve performance,"### Problem
There are possibly 2 problems solved by this proposal:
1. The Customer Portal commonly communicates with Zuora which can become a bottleneck for performance.
1. Plans are preloaded during the initialization of the Rails application which is a blocker for moving the Customer Portal app to Auto Devops.  Check out !525 for more details.

### Proposal
We should investigate using [the ""local records"" feature in IronBank](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank#local-records) to provide a caching layer for Zuora objects that don't commonly change.  According to the [IronBank docs](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank#local-records):

> If your product catalog does not change often, you may want to export it locally so that product catalog and related object queries look for local records first, then fallback to the API if no records are found.
> 
> You can export your product catalog locally using the LocalRecords class:
> ```
> # Save CSV files in the directory specified by `config.export_directory`
> IronBank::LocalRecords.export
> ```

With this change, we might be able to refactor or completely remove the eager loading of plans (defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/4ff55c5197239fa25e037f3749d9af1666804e9e/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L19) and initialized [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8c0c8b6c20692479ea8d9482721465ebb8f6aba6/config/application.rb#L69)

117482757,2022-10-24 19:06:37.952,"[Reseller] Update ""change linked namespace"" flow","## Problem

Currently, it's possible that if the customer tries to change the linked namespace to a namespace with more seats in use than seats in the subscription, they will be asked to pay for the additional seats.  

We cannot allow this transaction in Customers Portal, since customer should be transacting through a Reseller.

### How Support handles this today

When support encounters this situation, they:

1. Inform the customer that they have more users than purchased seats.
2. Propose the following options:
   1. Contact their purchase partner to purchase more seats.
   2. Deal with overages at the end of the subscription term (via True-Ups).
   3. Remove excess users.
3. Depending on what option was selected, wait for the daily sync job to run and re-calculate the Billable users count.
4. Link the subscription and confirm there are no overages recorded.

## Proposal

Update the `Change Linked Namespace` flow for a subscription that is purchased via a reseller.

- **If they have more users in their group than purchased seats**, display a message about the overage and let the user know that they will be charged for the overage at the end of their subscription term. Allow them to associate the subscription to the namespace regardless of overages.
- **If there is no overage** for a reseller customer, we will use the current flow (no changes needed).

 - In place of the `BaseTrialService`'s existing `create_platypus_lead` create a new `create_workato_lead` method utilizing the Sidekiq worker from gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#5012. This new method will want to take the same information as the existing method but hand it off to a local Sidekiq queue instead of Platypus.
 - In `TrialsController`, create a new method `create_hand_raise_workato_lead` to replace existing `create_hand_raise_platypus_lead`.
 - Introduce a new feature flag `switch_lead_creation_from_platypus_to_workato`

### Result

We're able to complete the full trial lead process without involving Platypus in the process.

### Next steps (if any)

Roll out the new method of posting Leads via a feature flag.

### How will we measure success?

We will consult with the Marketing Operations team to ensure that the newly posted data in Workato conforms to expectations and will work as expected for them in downstream processes.",2

### Problem

We're working to remove Platypus from the trial creation pipeline, but want to retain Workato as part of the process. Currently Platypus handles trial lead storage via an [asynchronous Bull worker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/integrations/platypus/-/blob/master/apps/server/src/marketing/commands/new-lead.command.ts#L42) that disconnects the time needed to service the request from the customer facing HTTP flow, the worker also handles posting failures to slack and email as needed.

### Problem

Customers Dot is not currently able to communicate with Workato to post leads from trials.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Workato uses OAuth and a REST api, customers dot already includes gems for handling both of those methods of communication. We just need to take the pieces and assemble them into a service that will allow us to post leads to Workato in a practical convenient way. To do this we will create a service that will abstract secret handling and routing requests to the correct end point on Workato.

The only method that we need to implement at present is POSTing to `https://apim.workato.com/marketo/lead`. There isn't solid documentation on fields available with that end point, however the [existing Platypus Service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/integrations/platypus/-/blob/master/apps/server/src/marketing/commands/new-lead.command.ts#L12) includes the names and types of all of the elements that we would want to include in our request.

We also need to create a new `Workato::LogLeadService` to replace existing `Platypus::LogLeadService`

### Result

There is a convenient service available to help facilitate the implementation of other tickets under this epic.

This should avoid confusion in thinking an `Account` in CustomersDot is the same as a GitLab `Organization`.

We also want to standardize naming across our Order to Cash systems in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9018.  Given this, we've identified the column name `BillingAccount.name` should be `BillingAccount.zuora_account_name` to avoid confusion.

### Proposal

Rename the `Account` model to `BillingAccount` avoid confusion.  Given we are renaming `Account`, let's also rename `AccountMembership` as well.

- Rename model `Account` to `BillingAccount`
   - Rename DB table `accounts` to `billing_accounts`
- Rename model `AccountMembership` to `BillingAccountMembership`
   - Rename DB table `account_memberships` to `billing_account_memberships`

116844100,2022-10-13 15:48:56.857,[UX] Navigation for CDot to represent new User/BillingAccount data structure,"## Problem

Right now a Customer record in CustomersDot represents a mixture of a physical user (Zuora Contact) and an Account (Zuora Customer Account). As discussed in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331+, this is a problem for a few reasons, leading to a variety of bugs. The ~""group::fulfillment platform"" team is working to correct this by introducing new data models to allow for Accounts and Account Memberships (and renaming Customers to Users to reduce confusion). Multiple Users in CDot should be able to be associated with a BillingAccount. On the flip side, one User record should be able to be associated with multiple BillingAccount (through BillingAccountMemberships).

The UI for CustomersDot currently only supports one User per BillingAccount and one BillingAccount per User. As we work on updating the data structure, we need to think about IA and navigational changes to allow an Account to have multiple billing managers and a User to have multiple BillingAccountMemberships.

## Proposal

Explore how the new data structure will impact the IA and navigation of CDot.

- How/where do Users manage their personal user data vs data associated with an BillingAccount(s)?
- How/where do Users associate additional Customers with an BillingAccount?
- If a User has multiple BillingAccount memberships, how does the choose which BillingAccount they are managing before the normal operations and features are shown, like Managing Purchases or Editing Account information?

While the output of this issue will be the final design/specs of the navigation for a customer with a single BillingAccount only, this issue will also explore, design, and validate navigation for customers with _multiple_ BillingAccounts (because we want to make sure that the navigation will scale to that use case).

### Information architecture

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

I wanted to understand how the new User/BillingAccount data architecture and IA will impact CDot navigation. 

:art: [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/6eubaRn3G9YP5PmVsHijlr/Navigation-for-CDot-to-represent-new-Customer%2FAccount-data-structure?node-id=0%3A1) for the explorations

#### Process

To start, I did a site map of the current state of CDot. I wanted to understand which information that currently lives under the User model will be moving to the BillingAccount model. Based on information in this [thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4799#note_1100958075) and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4799 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4793, I highlighted all affected information/pages in blue. 

![image](/uploads/bf7ceeed3af0db542495d2969e15821c/image.png)

From there, I started reorganizing and grouping the information, making a clearer distinction between what information lives on the User model and what information lives on the BillingAccount model. The team has already ironed out these details as part of spike/exploration work in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331, so this is really just a visualization of that work and thinking through how a user might access it and interact with it.

![image](/uploads/061023388554b5acf03dd127f70ce8da/image.png)

Because it's important to think about the navigation and IA holistically, the site map is based on the end state of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331+. However, I also wanted to think about how this work breaks down and how it fits into the iterations that we've outlined in that Epic. 

I mapped out which parts of the experience would be tackled as part of each iteration (and other key Fulfillment projects like https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8905+).

</details>

### Wireframes

**:clapper: Check out the [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/pbT0Wn4kWJQ)! (5 1/2 minutes)**

Topics addressed in the video:

* How does the introduction of the BillingAccount impact the *current* information architecture of CDot?
* How will the information architecture change to support the BillingAccount structure?
* What navigation options have been explored to represent that BillingAccount relationship to the user?
* What are the next steps and how can I give feedback?

See [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4973#note_1285983310) for more details about the wireframes and how to give feedback.

### Visual designs

Based on the feedback on the wireframes, I explored a variety of different visual designs for the navigation. There were two different designs that moved forward into solution validation.

| Option 1: Dropdown switcher in the left sidebar | Option 2: Account info page header with button to switch Accounts  |

### Prototypes

Each of the two visual design options were built out into full prototypes for user testing.

**Important note:** The content and design of many of the pages (such as the My accounts page, the Account details page, and the Billing managers page) is **not final or finished**. There are separate UX issues open to fully design and test these pages. But in order to test the navigation, there needed to be _something_ on those pages, so I threw together quick mockups for the purposes of the user test. 

**Prototype links**

116836724,2022-10-13 14:25:56.614,Account details form updates BillingAccount model,"### Problem

The current Account details form in CustomersDot updates the `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) record which has ActiveRecord callbacks to update the Zuora Account and Zuora Contact.  The Zuora Contact updated by this callback is [simply the first Zuora Contact associated to the Zuora Account](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/58c2d92e7fb4892f2326423300e6b9f6267a9632/app/services/update_contact_service.rb#L26).  It is a known bug that if the Zuora Account has more than one Zuora Contact, there is no guarantee this logic updates the correct Zuora Contact.

For reference, here's what the page looks like currently:
![Screen_Shot_2022-09-12_at_6.02.09_PM](/uploads/34922ad336fcff352258ac3c31cda96c/Screen_Shot_2022-09-12_at_6.02.09_PM.png)

Now that `BillingAccount` information is being stored locally, this form should also update `BillingAccount` locally as well as in Zuora.

### Proposal

The Account details form should allow the following:
- Show and update (local) `BillingAccount` record
- Show and update (remote) Zuora Account
- Show and update (remote) Zuora Contact (the correct one)

The look of the form should not need to change in this iteration as the app still only allows one `BillingAccount` per `Customer` (to be renamed `User`).  This form will be updated in later iterations as well, both in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8951+ and https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8986+.",3
116774753,2022-10-12 18:41:58.156,Customers with different BillTo/SoldTo contacts on the Zuora account are not receiving a Welcome email,"### Problem

As identified in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4924+, customers that are purchasing directly from GitLab via a Sales Rep are not receiving the Customers Portal [welcome email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/92e7ac101afa342c73a8896285e83ef6/welcome-to-portal-email.png). This only happens if the Sales Order (and Zuora account) has different contacts for BillTo and SoldTo.

### Proposal

Per [suggestion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4924#note_1126792349) from `@tyleramos`:

>>>
I think if we agree that this logic is flawed, and the purpose of billable was to determine reseller subscriptions, we should probably just remove the `billable` column altogether. We already have an accurate way of calculating [subscriptions managed by resellers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/01600a67144b2b47ba1857794f02ebb897a2e27b/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L74) which is [used to determine the ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/6d78d7ab5044fdb102e85f4f4709251f7384d99f/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L25)`login_activated` boolean column when processing callouts.

We should be able to simply remove the logic and column for `billable` and the welcome email would be sent to new customers that have zuora accounts and their subscription wasn't managed by a reseller. That seems like the desired behavior. We would have no need to send the `bill_to_id` at that point too, so it would be some simplification of the code and the params in the configured callouts.
>>>

* Reference to code that triggers the welcome email: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a370c2b4b1a4fec50a6be2291c7b0ec7c73e0cd7/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L79

### Result

All customers that purchase directly from GitLab (not Reseller) will receive a [Welcome email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/92e7ac101afa342c73a8896285e83ef6/welcome-to-portal-email.png).

<!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. -->

This issue is to rollout and cleanup [a feature to prevent enqueuing `SendSeatOverageNotificationJob` for certain namespaces](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934) in CustomersDot production, that is currently behind the [`block_seat_overage_notification`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/165/edit) feature flag.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::billing and subscription management"" 
- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_billing_and_subscription_management`
- Best individual to reach out to: @jhyson @tyleramos
- PM: @tgolubeva 

## Stakeholders

<!--
Are there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?

- GITLAB_HANDLE of a PM
- The Support Team
- The Delivery Team
-->

## The Rollout Plan

- This feature was rolled out immediately in production to mitigate the issue that was bloating [our Sidekiq queues](https://customers.gitlab.com/sidekiq/).

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

When enabled, this feature will prevent the `SendSeatOverageNotificationJob` from being enqueued for specific GitLab namespace ids (currently just `10782951`).  See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5582 for more info.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

The feature flag should make it easier to toggle this blocking logic.  If it doesn't work, it's possible that the `SendSeatOverageNotificationJob` doesn't get blocked properly for the specified namespace.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

We can monitor problems [in Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/) or [in Sidekiq](https://customers.gitlab.com/sidekiq/).

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [~] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4934) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Ensure https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358080 has been resolved before removing the feature flagged code.
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `block_seat_overage_notification` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/165/edit)",1
116614517,2022-10-10 21:36:23.684,[Reseller] Hide subscription management buttons for a subscription purchased via a reseller,"## Problem

Subscriptions purchased via a Reseller should not be amended via the Customers Portal. 

Any subscription changes should be done via the Reseller (and not the customer), since Resellers are responsible for paying the related invoices.

For screenshots of the current experience for Reseller customer (if they were able to login) see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/809+.


## Proposal

Hide the following buttons on the subscription card if the subscription is managed by a reseller:

- Add Seats
- Upgrade
- Resume
- Cancel
- Renew
- Buy additional CI Minutes
- Buy additional Storage

Looks like we have a `subscription.managed_by_reseller?` method in the code.

### SM Subscription card

All buttons should be removed.

There is one remaining bucket of customers for whom no cloud activation is created, meaning there no way for them to access an activation code other than requesting one be created by the support team:
* Customers with `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `No` - we do not generate a cloud activation for explicitly opted out customers

## Proposal
Update the activation code logic to create an activation code for all Self-Managed subscriptions, so that even opted out customers have the option of activating with cloud licensing.

## Experience
When a customer has `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `No` (opted for a legacy license), but an activation code exists, we show an expandable banner with both the legacy license available for download and the activation code:

116027508,2022-09-29 16:29:57.567,[Backfill] Create activation codes for subscriptions on legacy licenses pre-SCL,"## Background
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/589+ defines the process for customers to activate with Cloud Licensing mid-term if they already have an active legacy license subscription. For most customers, a Support ticket is required to move to Cloud Licensing.

To make it easier for these customers to self-activate with Cloud Licensing, this issue will evaluate the possibility of mass-generating activation codes for customers that do not have one.

## Details
Today, the Customer Portal subscription activation display banner for `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `null` has a dependency on if an activation code exists.
* If activation code exists: display legacy download option only
* If activation code does not exist: display activation code only

As of September 2022, we are creating activation codes for all subscriptions where `TurnOnCloudLicensing` is not = `No`. However, prior to SCL launch (July 2022), we did not create activation codes for these subscriptions.

## Proposal
1. Query the subscription names with `TurnOnCloudLicensing` set to `null` and `Status = ""Active""` in Zuora (with a Data Query, [example](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/platform/data-query/queries/20e2a75f-8e30-4ea6-b922-a0a73c80efde)) and then cross check those with existing cloud activations. 
2. If no cloud activation exists for the subscription name, create one.
3. In doing so, ensure we do NOT send customers emails with the activation code (to avoid confusion).

## Result
All customers (who did not explicitly opt out of Cloud Licensing, `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `No`) will have a cloud license activation code available for download visible in the Customer Portal, allowing for mid-term activations of cloud licensing without the need for a support ticket.",3

It is holding back our overall error budget.

By sorting the averge on [Grafana ranking](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/stage-groups-detail-provision/stage-groups-provision-group-error-budget-detail?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now&viewPanel=44), `Api::V1::SeatLinksController#create` seems to be the largest contributing factor. It usually peaks around 4 AM UTC each day at -50% mark. E.g. in CDot production log, I found one request taking 7s.

### Proposal

We should first gather stats on request time in order to see how the distribution and average looks like. Since we don't have log.gitlab.net for CDot this will take some manual effort.

Engineering-wise, we can look into reducing seat link time. 

The peak probably means a large number of self-managed instances are concentrated in the same timezone. We may also look into spreading the sync time further apart. 

Product management-wise: we may have to consider increase the request threshold (urgency). According to [Rails request Apdex SLI doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/application_slis/rails_request_apdex.html#decreasing-the-urgency-setting-a-higher-target-duration), automated process is not user face therefore it makes sense to have a lower urgency.

115802819,2022-09-26 18:51:05.619,Cloud License activation failure when future dated renewal and past subscription trueups,"# Bug

## Summary

When activating a cloud license for the first time (especially when coming from legacy), the cloud license is generated using the subscription version that better ""fits"" the activation moment / date.

Per @vshumilo:

> The subscription version is resolved [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/df807833e9e1b346bde9a0c0d2adf37a6ab89209/app/models/cloud_activation.rb#L23) using [this logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/df807833e9e1b346bde9a0c0d2adf37a6ab89209/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L70-L72)
> 
> Additional context
> - This decision was per-design to allow a customer that is in the middle of a subscription term to upgrade to cloud license we decided to use the current subscription version (applicable at the moment of the activation)
> - The specific logic on how this current subscription is resolved changed ~1 month ago, current one should be more accurate. Is this something you have seen reported in the last month or since the release of cloud activation?

However, in some cases when the following conditions are also true:

1. A future-dated renewal amendment exists
2. The current, pre-renewal version of the subscription has true-ups

The cloud license being generated is failing to activate until at least the start date of the renewal term when the license gets generated with the most recent version of the subscription.

It seems to be related to true-up checking (documented in at least 2 of the reported examples), and possibly current billable users since the trueup logic includes a [fallback check on current users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/066245b248aa8df95958302656b252705d0f74fc/ee/app/models/license.rb#L507-508) that would normally be skipped in cloud licenses.

Currently unknown why the true-up logic would be failing, even for the current (non-renewal) term; in theory it should be generating a license that works the same as it did at the start of the current term.  It's using `trueup_from` and `trueup_to` of the current period, in other words, `trueup_from == current_starts_at - 1 year` and `trueup_to == current_starts_at`

[example ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/329201)  
[example customer](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/205112/edit)  
[example cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1043282)

## Steps to reproduce

1. Be on legacy license
2. Have your current term subscription include true-ups
3. Adjust user counts in a way that prevents your current license from being reactivated
   - Either increase your billable users count, or your max historical (for current term)
4. Try to convert to cloud license prior to renewal

## Proposed fix

It's really the trueup logic at fault here, since that both re-validates current term trueups and also contains a current users check (which would be skipped without `License#check_trueup` being called).  Because these numbers can change over the course of a year, re-activating the current term license may be impossible.

Sidenote: Perhaps this highlights the [discussions in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/511).

1. Skip all of `License#check_users_limit`, `License#check_trueup`, and `License#check_restricted_user_count` when renewing or prior to renewing from legacy to cloud license the first time.
 
## Workarounds

1. Wait until start date of the renewal period

- Finance (@s_mccauley @annapiaseczna)

## The Rollout Plan

Percentage Rollout on CustomersDot

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

##### For all self served orders 

**First purchase**

- The creation of an `Account` object in CustomersDot as a counterpart to the Zuora Billing Account that will be created in Zuora. 
- The creation of an `AccountMembership` record in CustomersDot that will associate the Customer that made the purchase to the created `Account`.
- The SFDC associated account id information will be stored at the created `Account` level.

**Subsequent orders for the same Account**

Will reuse the Account created in the first step. Future orders might be initiated by the same or another Customer. A Customer initiating an order will be already associated to the account via an AccountMembership record to be able to place the order so the creation of this membership is not mentioned here.

##### For sales assisted orders will result in: 
- The creation of a `Customer` based on the provided information that will be reused as the Bill To / Sold To contact at the Zuora Account Level.
- The creation of an `Account` object in CustomersDot as a counterpart to the Zuora Billing Account.
- The creation of an `AccountMembership` based on the before mentioned Account and Customer.

**Subsequent orders for the same Account**

Will reuse the Account created in the first step. _To be reviewed: If the new order is associated to a different contact (different email) then we might create a new Customer + Account Membership in CustomersDot._

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

- Purchase flow will not work within CustomersDot.
- Provision for sales assisted orders will not work.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

- Keep an eye on [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/#).
- Check `#s_fulfillment_daily` for errors.
- Verify provisions are being fulfilled within the Provision Tracking System (Admin > Provisions)

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Ensure that the rake task to backfill Account and AccountMembership (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4798) has been run and verified.  This data must be populated before we enable the feature flag in the environment.
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=stg ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_with_customers[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=stg ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_cloud_activations[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=stg ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_licenses[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=stg ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_orders[false]`
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
   - https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C029YFPUA6M/p1674229395068479
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
   - https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C029YFPUA6M/p1674229669719009?thread_ts=1674229395.068479&cid=C029YFPUA6M
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Ensure [test plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5555) had been executed successfully
- [x] Ensure that the rake task to backfill Account and AccountMembership (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4798) has been run and verified.  This data must be populated before we enable the feature flag in the production environment.
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=production ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_with_customers[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=production ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_cloud_activations[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=production ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_licenses[false]`
    - [x] `RAILS_ENV=production ~/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rake data_maintenance:billing_accounts:backfill_orders[false]`
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

- [x] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5710+
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
  - [x] Ensure the cleanup issue is closed and all MRs have been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/160/edit)",2

### Problem
As mentioned in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4428#note_1108064352), we should not be showing subscription management buttons on CI minutes subscriptions without namespace attached.

### Proposal
As mentioned in point 3 of this [refinement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4428#note_1092677679), update the logic to hide subscription management buttons.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
Subscription management buttons should not be visible on CI minutes (and other free plans) with no linked namespace.

115447179,2022-09-20 18:28:25.941,Remove Visual Compliance except for eDisty Marketplace use,"### Problem

As described in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393#note_1106637176), Visual Compliance code is enabled for eDisty Marketplace Orders, but disabled for all other use in CustomersDot.  This is because Visual Compliance proved to not be as effective in screening, particularly outside of the US.  Given eDisty Marketplace Orders are starting out as US-only, we've enabled VC just for this workflow for now.  The intention eventually is for VC to be replaced with Risk Rate as described [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393#note_1107774308).

### Proposal

Given we do not want to enable VC for code paths other than eDisty Marketplace, let's remove this code to avoid confusion and potentially enabling this path by accident.

Note there are 2 distinct feature flags related to visual compliance: `compliance_check_marketplace` and `compliance_check`.  We want to keep the flag `compliance_check_marketplace`, but drop the flag for `compliance_check` and any related code.  

- `perform_compliance_check` [in application_controller.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e3d1c1a06c37668851bf96058ad78699288fa7e7/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L92)",2

115435024,2022-09-20 15:03:23.841,[Knowledge-sharing] True-ups,"# True-ups

## What are True-ups?

True-ups are the outstanding overage of maximum users exceeding the users/seats in a license of a self-managed subscription. Any overages during the subscription term need to be resolved by purchasing additional seats for the subscription. True-ups are handled as an add-on product to the subscription during renewal. They are validated when the new license is applied to a self-managed instance.

### How to find the overage

There are two places within a self-managed instance where the overage is displayed:
1. Visit the admin dashboard (`/admin`) and look for the `License overview` section. A box displays the overage number as `USERS OVER LICENSE`.
   <details>
   ![admin_dashboard](/uploads/2a4e2bffda091bdafcff3611f1423935/admin_dashboard.png)
   </details>
2. Visit the subscription page (`/admin/subscription`) to find a similar box as on the admin dashboard that displays the overage number as `USERS OVER SUBSCRIPTION`.
   <details>
   ![subscription](/uploads/e5f7c8f6201814dd0112d90a6ef6f34d/subscription.png)
   </details>


## Quarterly reconciliations

Quarterly reconciliations is a feature that is offered within Cloud Licenses. If enabled, a self-managed instance will send seat link information to CustomersDot on a daily basis. This information includes a count of active users and a historical maximum user count.

The manual true-up process is replaced by an automated quarterly reconciliation process which uses the information from the daily seat link sync to amend subscriptions with any additional users added within the past quarter.

### Difference to quarterly reconciliations (QSR)

True-ups are an annual process which means that users over the license needs to be paid for the whole subscription term. When the users were added is not important for this.

Quarterly reconciliations are performed quarterly. Any users over the license needs to be paid for for the remaining subscription term only. This process can result in substantial savings.

See [this documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html) for an example on the difference in costs.

## CustomersDot

### Subscription renewal

When renewing a self-managed subscription, a section for true-ups will be displayed. The customer is required to enter their current users over the license. Otherwise the license created for the renewal might not work on their instance (might will be explained in the GitLab section).

<details>
![renewal](/uploads/966d6de03d0ed59abbf4b6a3a2663599/renewal.png)
</details>

True-ups are handled as an add-on product to the subscription. [This code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L162-186) applies the true-up product if required.

When the license is created for the renewal, [the code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/models/license.rb#L82) checks if true-up info needs to be set. This is only the case if the true-up quantity is greater than 0 and the license has a term end date. If it is the case, the true-up date range [is automatically set](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0bd9c8aa410b0e3c924d17a9240db2644ff2e1b/app/models/license.rb#L160-165) to the year prior to the current subscription term.

### Manual license creation

When creating a license manually in the Admin, the true-up count can be filled in during the creation as an optional field. Similar to the renewal process, the overage number has to be sufficient to cover the current overage of an instance.

<details>
![license_creation](/uploads/811e3e93dc56cb71dcb2769c9290ae3f/license_creation.png)
</details>

## GitLab

When applying a license to a self-managed instance, [a validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/ba33e30e7295c3528e0eda559dc6768c3c90a257/ee/app/models/license.rb#L36) checks for a sufficient true-up count. This check is only executed if the true-up info is set and the flag `reconciliation_completed` (license restriction attribute) is not set to `true` in the license. If the latter is set to `true`, true-ups will be skipped due to a successful Q3 quarterly reconciliation.

The historical max during the given true-up date range is used for this validation ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/ba33e30e7295c3528e0eda559dc6768c3c90a257/ee/app/models/license.rb#L502)). If a previous user count (license restriction attribute `previous_user_count`) is present in the license, the historical max subtracted by the previous user count equals the expected true-up count. If the previous user count is missing, the daily billable users count is used instead (there's a reported bug for this fallback in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361345).

The expected true-up count is then compared to the true-up count set in the license plus an additional 10% overage threshold (hence the ""might not work"" phrasing in the CustomersDot section). The threshold part is only available in versions ""%14.2""+. If it's greater or equal the restricted user count (license restriction attribute `active_user_count`) is validated. This validation adds an error to the user count if the restricted user count plus a 10% overage threshold is less than the restricted user count in the license. If the expected true-up count is less than the true-up count set in the license plus an additional 10% overage threshold, the true-up validation results in an error that is added to the base errors (errors that are not associated to a specific attribute).

- https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/quote-to-cash/troubleshooting/#true-ups-adding-seats-users

## Possible improvements

1. No documentation about true-ups in CustomersDot. Is documentation in GitLab already sufficient?
1. Consolidate different spellings of true-up. GitLab, CustomersDot and the handbook use a mix of `true-up`, `trueup` and `true up`. It looks like `true-up` is the spelling that is used for customer-facing content.
   * **Here's one merge request that refactors the spelling in CustomersDot docs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6225+**
1. A previous investigation suggested to loosen the true-up validation for Cloud Licenses or even skip it entirely. This is still under discussion though, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362076+.

As raised in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5390#note_1105664081), `Cancel subscription` button is shown on expired subscriptions.

### Proposal
Add a condition to hide `Cancel subscription` button on expired subscriptions. We could add a similar condition like the one for `Resume subscription` in `eligible_for_resumption?` in `subscription.rb`. Since the condition is common for `Cancel` and `Resume` logic, we could move it to the `recurrent_subscription?` method in `subscription.rb`.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
`Cancel subscription` button will not be shown on expired subscriptions.

### Problem

[`ActionTypesGenerator`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d482c68e02279a049e34766362baa76efd869d95/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb) currently determines applicable actions types for a request on an individual basis.

This approach was found to have the following two shortcoming:

1. The order (or priority) in which the order actions were sent to Zuora may not be appropriate
   For e.g. when upgrading a self-managed subscription plan during renewal and true-ups are added, `AmendmentSubscriptionService` currently generates amendment in the following order:

   - Remove main product
   - Add main product
   - Renew subscription
   - Add true-ups

  In the current implementation of `ActionTypesGenerator`, it will generate these order actions in the following order:

   - [Remove main product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d482c68e02279a049e34766362baa76efd869d95/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb#L39)
   - [Add main product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d482c68e02279a049e34766362baa76efd869d95/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb#L43)
   - [Add true-ups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d482c68e02279a049e34766362baa76efd869d95/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb#L65)
   - [Renew subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d482c68e02279a049e34766362baa76efd869d95/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb#L49)

   Given Zuora processes Order actions in the order in which it is sent, it is critical to maintain the priority of the action types:

   ![Screen_Shot_2022-09-15_at_5.37.46_PM](/uploads/27c5cbdbb32ec750f4870b120b24fbf1/Screen_Shot_2022-09-15_at_5.37.46_PM.png)

2. In the event when an order action type is twice: e.g when updating main product, and when updating options product OR when upgrading to a new product and adding true-ups. The determination logic is replicated in both `ActionTypeGenerator` and in `ParamConstructor`.


### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

In order to resolve these two issues, action type in `ActionTypesGenerator` can be determined using business logic. `ActionTypesGenerator` returns a list of action types that are specific to CDot, such as `add_main_product`, `add_true_ups`, `remove_main_product`, `update_support_options` and so on.

Crete a mapping of these business driven action types with that of Zuora before invoking Orders API.

115166607,2022-09-15 20:30:06.020,Salesforce object creation behavior in CustomersDot,"### Background

Via the integration with SFDC, Salesforce objects are created in CustomersDot following any self service purchases.  These CDot services that integrate with Salesforce use `Customer` (later to be renamed `User`) information stored in the CDot database like company name, first and last name, email, country, state, zip to create the Salesforce objects.

In https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331, Fulfillment is looking at improving the data architecture of CDot, in particular the `Customer`/`BillingAccount` alignment.  We are focusing on simplifying the `Customer` model, and treating this more like a ""User of the Customer Portal"" (later to be renamed `User`), persisting mainly email address, first name and last name.  These `Customer`s (later renamed `User`s) would have memberships to `BillingAccount`s, which represent Zuora Accounts.  Much of the data that is pulled from `Customer` currently, could be pulled directly from Zuora (and potentially cached in CDot in later iterations) via the Zuora Account and the Sold To Contact for the `BillingAccount`.

### Proposal

Investigate whether CustomersDot can use the Sold To Contact from the Subscription's Zuora Account, instead of `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) data stored in the CDot DB, to create the appropriate SFDC objects (Account, Contact, Opportunity, etc).

Services in question:
- All services in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/app/services/salesforce
- [`CreateSalesforceContactService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/edf972ee51f37d98f23a0e38828e5c01d0f5ed3a/app/services/create_salesforce_contact_service.rb)
- [`CreateSalesforceAccountService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/99ecaa74572bcf1542b5ab9fadba3f410b402b18/app/services/create_salesforce_account_service.rb#L3)

### Delivery strategy

- [x] :one: Update the CustomersDot matching strategy to find an account within SFDC (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5970):

From:
- Find SFDC Account by CusomersDot user `salesforce_account_id`
- Find SFDC Account by CustomersDot user's Zuora Account `crm_id`
- Find SFDC Contact by exact match to the CustomersDot user's email -> then find the Account for the Contact

To:
- Find SFDC Account by CustomersDot user's Zuora Account `crm_id`
- Exact match with the Zuora Sold To contact email
- Find SFDC Contact by exact match to the CustomersDot user's email -> then find the Account for the Contact

Diff:
- **Remove:** ~~Find SFDC Account by CusomersDot user `salesforce_account_id`~~
- Find SFDC Account by CustomersDot user's Zuora Account `crm_id`
- **New:** Exact match with the Zuora Sold To contact email
- Find SFDC Contact by exact match to the CustomersDot user's email -> then find the Account for the Contact

---

- [x] :two: Update the SFDC Account / Contact creation logic: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6151

From: Be based on the CustomersDot user's data.

To: Be based on the CustomersDot user's Zuora Account Sold To Contact data.

This change is added behind the `:create_sf_contact_from_zuora_contact` feature flag given:
- We might have to hand out validation for the changes working properly in staging to another team, possibly not related to engineering.
- Failures in the SFDC Contact and Account creation will impact revenue metrics.

## Background
Today, not all cloud licensing subscriptions are generated for the full subscription term.

The logic defined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b555261242ad22c16a988161f2615b8aa07cb78f/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L7-20) defines license end date upon creation of a license. The way this logic is written, if a customer purchases a multi-year subscription and is:

1. On Cloud Licensing AND (QSR OR Ramp): license is issued for the full term purchased for :white_check_mark:
1. On Cloud Licensing AND **(NOT on QSR and Not on Ramp)**: license is issued for one year only :exclamation:


The thinking for this was that it provides sales with the opportunity for checking for true-ups prior to the start of a new year.

## Problem
With this logic, all Cloud Licensing Multi-Year Subscriptions where the customer is not on QSR will expire after 1 year. This will result in the customer losing access entirely at the start of the second year, unless: 
* Sales creates a new $0 quote for the second year, it is synced to Zuora/CDot, and then the customer receives a new activation code? :thinking: this is the only way to avoid this I can think of.
* This is definitely not a process sales is familiar with.

Related to this, because of the logic of `term start date` + `1 year`, we are actually creating expired activation codes on year 2. Separate issue for this specifically created here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4815

### What is the Impact?
We expect the majority of customers who are on Cloud Licensing to also have QSR enabled, however, the following categories of customers are currently opted out of QSR by default, but not out of Cloud Licensing:
1. Channel customers
2. PubSec customers
3. PO Required customers
4. MSA customers
5. Legacy Ramp customers
6. Customers on non-standard terms


A quick report of new/renewal quotes sent to Zuora with a `Close Date` in 2022, `Initial Term` > `12`, `TurnOnCloudLicensing__c` = `Yes` and `TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` = `No`:
* 40 quotes

Looking at this same criteria but New quotes (not yet sent to Zuora), we see:
* 92 quotes

However, with SCL launch having only happened 2 months ago, we can expect this number to continue to increase at a higher rate as all customers are set to `TurnOnCloudLicensing__c` = `Yes` by default.

5. A [Mid-Market Customer](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001kHwnHQAS) has encountered this after the first year of their 3-Year contract resulted in an ""expired"" cloud activation. [Ticket for reference](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/351591).

## Proposal

**Summary:** Update license creation logic to generate all cloud licenses for the full term

We can remove the dependency on QSR for generating a full term license. Instead, all cloud licenses could be generated for the full, Multi-Year term.

**Pros:**
* Eliminates risk of customer losing instance access/downgrading to free
* Smoother customer experience, no need to enter a new activation code each year
* Aligned to communications put out about cloud licensing, that there is no need for additional engagement each year as there is with legacy licenses

**Cons:**
* Potential loss of revenue as customer would not have an obligation to pay for true-ups prior to beginning the second/third year of their subscription term


_NOTE: given the current process for creating ramp deals as 3 unique subscriptions, we should not remove the dependency here for creating 1-year subscriptions for a ramp deal._


<details><summary>Alternative option, ruled out</summary>

#### Maintain current logic but define sales process for non-QSR customers

Potentially, this is by design and sales leadership would prefer to keep this logic in place. If so, we need to make sure that the process is clearly understood by the sales team if their customer is on CL and not QSR. To be considered: additional enablement, sales alerts for upcoming license expiration.

**Pros:**
* Allows for the possibility of reconciling true-ups, increase in revenue

**Cons:**
* If sales is not proactive, can result in customer loss of access/downgrade to free

### Result
All cloud licenses are to be generated for the full subscription term. Customers will no longer lose access after 1 year on a MY subscription.",1

Note: This is not an exhaustive list.  As we start working on this issue, we could promote this to a sub-epic and create issues for smaller pieces.

### Proposal

Let's review the application code to find all the places where `salesforce_account_id` is referenced from a `Customer`.  When the feature flag (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4794) is enabled, the `Customer`'s `BillingAccountMembership` should be used instead.  In many instances, the logged in Customer would have selected the `BillingAccount` they wish to administer, so this scope should be set and used to fetch `salesforce_account_id` instead of using the `salesforce_account_id` directly on `Customer`.

The legacy code will be removed in a later issue once the feature flag has been vetted and promoted in production.",1

### Problem

[`ParamConstructor`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/tree/main/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/) (`Zuora::Orders::Actions::ParamConstructor`) is a set of middleware services that sanitizes and formulates params required by an order action service (`Zuora::Orders::Actions`).

Currently, `ParamConstructor` returns a single object, assuming that a transaction can contain an Order action type only once. While this is true for most order actions in the existing business driven actions, there are a few exceptions such as:

  - `UpdateProduct`: a single transaction can update [main product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d2ccaa0f4eab6ff879d4b00a8e5a9ac77db9a9f3/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L83) as well as [options product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d2ccaa0f4eab6ff879d4b00a8e5a9ac77db9a9f3/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L94)

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

- Update `params` in `Zuora::Orders::Actions::BaseService` to be an Array of Objects instead of a single Object
- Update `.execute` in `Zuora::Orders::Actions::BaseService` to loop through `params` 
- Individual `Zuora::Orders::Actions::ParamConstructor` returns an array instead of an object

### Result

- Ability to add more than one instance of an OrderAction type in a transaction 
- Signature of `ParamConstructor` is consistent for all order actions

Note: This is not an exhaustive list.  As we start working on this issue, we could promote this to a sub-epic and create issues for smaller pieces.

### Proposal

Let's review the application code to find all the places where `zuora_account_id` is referenced from a Customer.  When the feature flag (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4794) is enabled, the `Customer`'s `BillingAccountMembership` should be used instead.  In many instances, the logged in `Customer` would have selected the `BillingAccount` they wish to administer, so this scope should be set and used instead of using the `zuora_account_id` directly on `Customer`.

The legacy code will be removed in a later issue once the feature flag has been vetted and promoted in production.

**2022-12-16 UPDATE:** [We've broken this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4807#note_1211450977) into an epic with many issues.  I moved this issue into the [newly created epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9515) and I've narrowed the focus of this issue to just those items that have been delivered to this point (admin changes and updates to the reconciliation services).",5

Once Account and AccountMembership models are added, Support and other GitLab members will need a way to manage these records via the CustomersDot Admin interface.

### Proposal

Let's sections to the Admin interface (http://customers.gitlab.com/admin) for the new models `Account` and `AccountMembership`.  This should allow admins to:

- View all Accounts
- View AccountMemberships for an Account
- View AccountMemberships for a Customer
- Create an AccountMembership
- Delete an AccountMembership

Other functionality like creating or editing an Account, might be useful, but let's check with the team on this before adding, or it could always be added later.",3
114969953,2022-09-13 15:13:54.902,Add billing_account_id to Order,"### Problem

The `Order` model currently has an association with an individual `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) via foreign key `customer_id`.  This relationship is problematic for many reasons and should be associated with a `BillingAccount` instead.

### Proposal

With the new data structure for `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership`, the `Order` model should be updated to be associated with a `BillingAccount` instead of a `Customer`.  The full migration will need to be done in steps, spread across multiple issues and MRs.  

For this issue, we will focus on getting to compatibility mode where `customer_id` continues to be set, but the `billing_account_id` will also be set.  In this issue, the following should be covered:

- [x] Add `billing_account_id` column - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5750
- [x] Start setting `billing_account_id` in application logic (e.g. when creating/updating a `Order`) - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5770
- [x] Use new `billing_account` relationship instead of `customer` when `account_data_structure` [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867) is enabled - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5874
- [x] Introduce rake task to backfill `billing_account_id` for existing `Order` records - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5967
   - ~~If it's easier, this could be added to the rake task from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4798.  Or it could be a standalone task.~~

### Result

`billing_account_id` will be populated similar to how `customer_id` is set currently.  `customer_id` will continue to be populated to ensure compatibility and allow us to revert if needed.  When the feature flag is enabled, the new `billing_account_id` will be used instead of `customer_id`.",3
114968429,2022-09-13 15:03:37.936,Add billing_account_id to License,"### Problem

The `License` model currently has an association with an individual `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) via foreign key `customer_id`.  This model really should be associated with a `BillingAccount` instead of an individual `Customer`.  Most data that references `Customer` should be pulled directly from the `BillingAccount`, or from the Sold To Contact associated with the `BillingAccount`.

### Proposal

114901357,2022-09-12 21:45:12.448,Backfill BillingAccounts and BillingAccountMemberships for existing Customers,"### Problem

Once `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` records are being created (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4795 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4796) and kept in sync (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4797), we should be in a position to confidently backfill this data for existing `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) records.

### Proposal

Create a rake task to backfill `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` records for existing `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) records.  We should consider an idempotent rake task that can be run multiple times.  We may need to run this several times as we test out the issues for creating `BillingAccount`s and keeping the information in sync.  

This task will need to be run at least once before [the feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/160/edit), `account_data_structure`, is enabled to ensure we can confidently start using the new data architecture in production.  Steps have been added to the feature flag rollout issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867+, to run the rake task introduced in this issue in non-production, then production environments.  As part of this issue, we should verify the rake task works by running it in staging and production to test, but we will run it again as part of the feature flag rollout.  Please update [the rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867) with the exact rake task command to run in staging and production.

Question to consider:
- What happens when the `zuora_account_id` and `salesforce_account_id` aren't consistent between `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) records associated to the same `BillingAccount`?  We should probably run a query to see how prevalent this is.  If this does happen, how prevalent is it and can we account for these discrepancies programmatically?",3
114901124,2022-09-12 21:38:50.695,Mechanism to keep BillingAccount data in sync with Zuora,"### Problem

With `BillingAccount` records being created and stored locally in CustomersDot, it will be important to make sure the data stored locally is kept in sync with the Single Source of Truth, Zuora.  The main concern at this point might be the `BillingAccount` `name` as we may not be caching much else locally.  We can reference the issue where the `BillingAccount` model was introduced for more information, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4792.

### Proposal

In this issue, we need to work with @gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects to build the mechanism for ensuring changes to Zuora Account (mainly `name` and `salesforce_account_id`) are synced to CustomersDot.  

We've engaged the Finsys team via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/886.  In that issue, the Finsys team will create a Custom Event for Zuora Account which will send a callout notification to CustomersDot.

In this issue, we will be responsible for creating the API endpoint for updating the `BillingAccount` record based on this callout notification.

##### Checklist

- [x] Add new API endpoint to enqueue sync account background job
  - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5995
- [x] Add sync account worker to update BillingAccount with Zuora Account data

When we arrive at a solution, we should add tests to ensure that this _mechanism_ indeed passes and receives correct data with Zuora.  This will likely take the form of integration tests, but contract tests would also work.",5
114900593,2022-09-12 21:26:59.551,Create BillingAccountMembership when processing Zuora Callouts,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4795, the `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` should be created when a purchase originates from CustomersDot (ie. self service purchase).  However, there are still places where the `BillingAccount` and/or `BillingAccountMembership` should be created outside of this workflow.

- Sales-assisted purchases
- Renewals

In these cases, CustomersDot processes the callout from Zuora in order to update the `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) and provision the subscription.  The Zuora callout code in CustomersDot needs to be updated to handle `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` creation.

### Proposal

In this issue, the `FindOrCreateCustomerService` should be updated to create an `BillingAccountMembership` for a `Customer` (to be renamed `User`) when the `zuora_account_id` attribute is present.  It should also consider creating the `BillingAccount` if it doesn't already exist.

If an existing `Customer` is found, but the `Customer` is not associated with the `BillingAccount` matching `zuora_account_id`, a new `BillingAccountMembership` (and potentially new `BillingAccount`) could be created.  

We've decided for this first iteration (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950), that we want to ensure only one `BillingAccountMembership` for a Customer.  This is to keep the same behavior as before, allowing us to step into the new data architecture and roll out the changes more effectively.  See the description in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950#purpose for more info.

#### Feature flag

This logic will be feature flagged in the short term using [the `:account_data_persistence` flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/171/edit). Here is the rollout issue for it: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5060+. Once we confirm the data is being created as expected and doesn't have any negative effects with the existing creation behavior, we will remove this feature flag.

As this is just creating data in the new models but not using it yet, we shouldn't need to use the `:account_data_structure` [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/160/edit) for this logic. Eventually, the code setting `customer.zuora_account_id` will be removed but for now both will be set. This will allow us to roll out changes more efficiently without worry of breaking existing functionality.

114895045,2022-09-12 19:37:07.677,Introduce a feature flag for using new Account structure,"### Proposal

To deliver features more efficiently and safely, let's introduce a feature flag that can be used to gate the new logic for using Accounts and AccountMemberships.  The feature flag could be named something like `account_data_structure` but open to other suggestions.  When the flag is enabled, the new data structure would be used, otherwise continue to use the old relationships.  Even when the flag is disabled though, we could start populating Accounts and Account Memberships to get into a ""compatibility mode"" where we could easily switch the flag on and off as needed.

TODOs:

- [x] Create the [feature flag in CustomersDot project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags): [account_data_structure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/160/edit) created.

CustomersDot needs a model that represents a `Customer`'s membership to an `Account`.  This would be similar, but not a 1:1 mapping to a Zuora Contact.

### Proposal

Create migration and model for `AccountMembership` which represents a `Customer` ability to manage an `Account` (Zuora Billing Account).

Attributes to consider for model:

* id
* customer_id
* account_id

The relationships created in this join table will be informed by Zuora Contact data, typically received via Zuora Callouts.  When processing callouts or after a purchase is made in CustomersDot, the `AccountMembership` may be created as a result.  This will be implemented in later issues.",2
114890145,2022-09-12 18:12:14.419,Create Account model,"### Problem

CustomersDot needs a model that represents a Zuora Customer Account.

### Proposal

Create migration and model for `Account` that maps 1:1 with a Zuora Customer Account.

Attributes to consider for model:
- `id`
- `name` (e.g. Customer.company_name)
- `zuora_account_id`
- `salesforce_account_id`

Other attributes to consider:
- `company_size`
   - This may not need to be persisted on Account as it is currently only used when creating the Salesforce Account when creating a subscription via `SubscriptionManagerService`.  I don't think it is needed for future purchases and therefore probably does not need to be synced.
- `vat_code`
   - This may not need to be persisted on Account as it is currently only used in `SubscribeService` or `Zuora::Orders::Entities::NewAccount` before a new account is created.  I don't think it is needed for future purchases and therefore probably does not need to be synced.
- `billable`
   - This attribute probably makes more sense at the `Customer` or `AccountMembership` level, but may not make sense as currently implemented.  It's used only to determine which customers should receive a welcome email.  This may require a follow-up issue, perhaps not part of this epic.
- `login_activated`
   - This attribute probably makes more sense at the `Customer` or `AccountMembership` level, but may not make sense as currently implemented.  When enabled, this attribute prevents access to CustomersDot.  It is set when a Zuora Callout is processed and a subscription is determined to be managed by a reseller.  This may require a follow-up issue, perhaps not part of this epic.

It might be a good idea to review [the latest `schema.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/db/schema.rb#L112) to make sure all appropriate Customer attributes have been considered for the Account model.

We are leaning towards very light duplication of data that exists in Zuora, and rely on fetching from Zuora when needed.  We will revisit caching in later iterations, but it probably makes sense to store Account `name` and `salesforce_account_id` locally on this table given they will be used frequently.  This means we will need to keep this model in sync with Zuora, which will be implemented in a later issue.",2
114866402,2022-09-12 13:50:09.007,Consolidate subscription state finding logic,"### Problem

For a few of the issues in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8402, new logic was introduced in CustomersDot to find subscription state.  This new logic was introduced in [the `Subscriptions::VersionManager` class](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/647dcf59d97e50410274960ab0c847e24b7097ab/app/services/subscriptions/version_manager.rb), used in [the `Subscription#previous_subscription` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/bf2057bd9b9e6dcadbcdff3e0ad43fb4b9d65d43/app/models/subscription.rb#L214) as well as a handful of other places.

There are a few other places, such as the ones below, where subscription state is determined for fetching the current subscription or future versions.

- [`Subscription#current_subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/bf2057bd9b9e6dcadbcdff3e0ad43fb4b9d65d43/app/models/subscription.rb#L48)

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5062

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",1

114609928,2022-09-07 20:10:21.104,Determine TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS order action using Orders API,"### Problem

Use `ActionTypeGenerator` to determine when a request pertains to updating `TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS` of a subscription.

### Proposal

![Amendment_Manager_Service](/uploads/0d268933ceafe24643b111892095c38d/Amendment_Manager_Service.png)

In this issue, we address (1), (2) and (3) for 'TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS' functionality in the following ways:

(1) Add method `#check_terms_and_conditions` to `Orders::Amendment::ActionTypesGenerator` (see `#check_renewal` for implementation structure). The method returns based on the `params` whether a product is being added to subscription. Use existing logic from `AmendSubscriptionService`.

(2) Add method `#terms_and_conditions` to `Zuora::Orders::FeatureAvailability`. This checks if `Unleash.enabled?(:use_orders_api_terms_and_conditions_workflow)` is enabled. Add `terms_and_conditions` to `SUPPORTED_TYPES` constant

(3) Create validator `Zuora::Orders::Amendment::Validators::TermsAndConditions`. Implement `#validate` method that validates if the request for updating terms and conditions is valid. (see `Renewal validator` for implementation structure). Use existing validation logic from `AmendSubscriptionService`. If no validation is present, the validator can return an empty array.

Create FF `use_orders_api_terms_and_conditions_workflow`.

### Problem
Customer received a generic error while trying to apply a cloud license activation code. Details:
* Customer had seat overages, but paid for them as true-ups. However they were applied as two different line items. Was the system maybe not recognizing that all true-ups were paid for?
* They first tried to apply the activation code prior to the subscription start date of the renewal; this is when the error occurred. Once they tried on the first day, they were successful in activating. Could the date be a factor?

### Background

With https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6438, new subscription creation and amendment to existing subscriptions will be executed using Zuora's Orders API instead of Subscribe and Amend API.

After a subscription is created, an account in SalesForce is [created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0563d4d477684f0a49b56e57fff2eeb8ba8f469/app/services/subscription_manager_service.rb#L77).
After a subscription is amended, an opportunity is created in SalesForce ([source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0563d4d477684f0a49b56e57fff2eeb8ba8f469/app/services/self_service/subscriptions/update_service.rb#L57)).

When a subscription is amended, the [list of amendments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0563d4d477684f0a49b56e57fff2eeb8ba8f469/app/services/self_service/subscriptions/update_service.rb#L97) are sent to the opportunity creation service and the opportunity creation payload includes attributes that are [retrieved from the amendments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a0563d4d477684f0a49b56e57fff2eeb8ba8f469/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_objects_service.rb#L104).

### Problem

Zuora's Orders API creates composite amendments, however they will [no longer be available once Orders harmonization is turned off](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4643#note_1079761771). (Orders harmonization lets the use of both Orders and Subscribe & Amend apis in parallel).

Thus, before rolling out the use of Orders API for amendment related actions, we need a way to determine:

  - [ ] does this change require updates to Amendment Quote (currently `sObject` is set to `zqu__QuoteAmendment__c` and result key to `quote_amendment_id`)? This requires input from `Sales Systems` team. 
        Please note this will also require a plan to support both types during the transition period from Amendment API to Orders API.

  - [ ] will this change involve updates to existing attributes or inclusion of any new attributes? This requires input from `Sales Systems` team. 

  - [x] determining the amendment related attributes that corresponds with Orders. Possible leads include using invoice line items / abstracting information from order actions. This requires input from `Fulfillment engineering` team. 

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

TBD

### Result

Opportunity creation in SalesForce works seamlessly with the migration to Orders API.

In reviewing this logic, it was determined that there was no need for the SS field dependency (detailed reasoning outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4688#note_1070731626)). As a result, this was removed as part of this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4688

## Problem
Since this update, we have identified that the activation code logic still includes the check that a purchase was completed through a self-service path. With the SS logic removed, this is now preventing activation code creation for _all_ sales assisted Self-Managed purchases.

_Note: self-service purchases are still working as expected_

Remove the `self_service?` check altogether from the activation code logic.

- the new customer record is not committed (because we are using [DB transaction](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fc0f52c30c4420b8f79d8b3a2ba2c4da04236ece/app/services/marketplace/create_subscription_service.rb#L21-26))
- the [new order creation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fc0f52c30c4420b8f79d8b3a2ba2c4da04236ece/app/services/marketplace/create_subscription_service.rb#L28) has not finished yet

In reality, these are less likely(we assume the Postgres DB transaction and Rails code runs fast enough). But we should ensure to handle this safely.

Depends on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4732+

### Proposal

In the Zuora callback worker, add a validation as the first thing:
 1. check whether this is a marketplace subscription. If it is NOT a marketplace subscription, return.
     - A marketplace subscription is a subscription with: `Marketplace::CHANNELS.include?(external_subscription_source)`
 2. query the MarketplaceOrder table, check the order status. raise exception if the `status != :created`.
     - The Zuoracallback worker will retry, per the Sidekiq worker retry settings.
     - If it does not succeed after all retries, this requires a manual check. This is unexpected. Actually, most likely we will perform more frequently(probably daily) check the failed Marketplace order.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result

Avoid unexpected errors from duplicated Customer record and Order record creation competition. -- as the same customer/order creation will be initiated from both Rails(Marketplace::CreateSubcriptionService) and Sidekiq(ZuoracallbackWorker).

The proposal is [option 2 in the comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4637#note_1066891473).

We allow the same `external_subscription_source`/`external_subscritpion_id` to retry when the request processing failed. For other status, we reject the request with an error message.
* When a Marketplace request comes, we search saved `external_subscription_source`/`external_subscritpion_id` with `status != 'failed'`. If found, reject the request. Otherwise, continue.
* We **upsert** `external_subscription_source`/`external_subscritpion_id`, update the status as `in_progress`.

114125828,2022-08-30 06:25:46.935,Track the Marketplace order status,"### Background:

**NOTE**: ATM we only have one Marketplace partner, which is `Arrowsphere`. So the below description uses `Arrow` to describe the scenario. However, this scenario applies to all Marketplace orders. It does not limit to Arrow.

Previously Arrow system talks to Gitlab Platypus API endpoint(and then Platypus talks to CustomersDot). We will remove Platypus in this communication chain.

* previously(as of today): `Arrow -> Platypus -> CustomersDot`
* after removing Platypus, Arrow will directly talk to CustomersDot: `Arrow -> CustomersDot`

In order to achieve this, there are several changes required on CustomersDot side.

1. implement OAuth provider in CustomersDot. This allows secure API access control. We propose to use `doorkeeper` gem.
1. add required data mapping in CustomersDot. This maps some Arrow payload data to the CustomersDot/Zuora/SFDC required values.
1. track the Arrow order status. The status is used to:  allow Arrow to poll the order status; validate duplicate requests; ensure to take action safely only on the right order status.
1. provide API endpoint for Arrow to poll the order status.

For more information, refer to the task breakdown at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4637#note_1062429151.

### This issue's scope

This issue covers the thrid task `track the Arrow order status`

#### Proposal

Create a table `MarketplaceOrders`(columns: `external_subscription_source, external_subscription_id, payload, status(:creating, :failed, :created, :provisioned)`. This has the benefit to prevent duplicated API requests from Arrow.

* An Arrow create order request comes
* If there is a validation error, return failure without tracking this order.
* Check the existence of `external_subscription_id`/`external_subscription_source`. 
   * If does not exists, create new `marketplace_orders` record for this `external_subscription_id`/`external_subscription_source`, and mark the status as `:creating`. Continue
   * If exists and the status is `:failed`, reset the order(status to `:creating`, payload to new payload). Continue.
   * If exists and the status is not `:failed`, return duplicated order error.
* Start to create the customer/subscription/order/sfdc..
* If the CDot failed to create the subscription, mark the status as `failed`
* When customer/subscription/order are created, mark status as `:created`
* After notify_customer(this is currently in ZuoracallbackWorker), mark the status as `:provisioned`.

#### Where does the `check duplicate marketplace order` sit in the process flow.
**NOTE**: this is a simplified flowchart. It does not contain some steps like `map payload`, `check Visual compliance`, `check customer existance`. We could also consider all of these as part of the general `create subscription` node.

### Problem

During the process of moving JavaScript code to `webpack` we don't do anything with styles. But we are going to drop `sprockets` completely. Dropping it will require moving styles processing to `webpack` too. I also would like to point that we will connect Pajamas Design System via Node.js packaging system (`@gitlab/ui`).

### Proposal

Move styles processing to `webpacker` too.

Note: moving to webpacker is also on the CSS roadmap for the GitLab project. https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/950#css-roadmap 

### Result

This will make the process of moving to Pajamas easier. For example, #663.

### Problem

Historically, trials were integrated with the customer portal to store customer data. This leads to an additional point of failure with trials if something goes wrong, and Fulfillment becomes a bottleneck for fixing any trial issues which are dependent on this integration as Marketing cannot fix it themselves. It also makes it harder to identify issues with trials if there are more points of failure.

### Proposal

Trials should not need to interact with the portal or any other tool other than Marketo > Salesforce for lead creation. We should remove any integrating code regarding trials from the portal and run a clean up of customer information and accounts in the portal that relates to trials.

### Problem

When installing a new license with seats less than historical max, the warning message is a bit misleading like below.

> “During the year before this license started, the GitLab installation had 77 active users, exceeding this license’s limit of 50 by 27 users. Please upload a license for at least 77 users or contact renewals@gitlab.com.”

The customer actually needs to pay true-up if they don't need to keep 77 users for the renewal. Once the license includes the true-up and seats for the new year it will work.

### Proposal

New message should display 

MVC (all cases) 

`The submitted license is not compatible with this system’s usage: X active users, Y maximum users and Z users in license. Please get in touch with our [Support team](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293) for further assistance.`

### Problem

Extra purchased CI minutes do not apply to namespace where the namespace **path** contains a `.`. I suspect there was a change to the `/namespaces` endpoint.

`GET` works as expected, for example `GET /namespaces/deandre.test-group.2` returns:

```
{
  ""id"": 4248792,
  ""name"": ""deandre-test-group-2"",
  ""path"": ""deandre.test-group.2"",
  ""kind"": ""group"",
  ""full_path"": ""deandre.test-group.2"",
  ""parent_id"": null,
  ""avatar_url"": null,
  ""web_url"": ""https://gitlab.com/groups/deandre.test-group.2"",
  ""members_count_with_descendants"": 1,
  ""shared_runners_minutes_limit"": null,
  ""extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit"": null,
  ""billable_members_count"": 1,
  ""plan"": ""free""
}
```

`PUT` (and presumably `POST`) fails, for example `PUT /namespaces/deandre.test-group.2?extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit=1000` returns:

```
{
  ""error"": ""404 Not Found""
}
```

### Problem
Our pipelines are randomly going red, the constant factor are tests heavily interacting with Zuora.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/jobs/294574079 (this one is waiting a full minute)
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/jobs/294376711


### Proposal

Short term: disable the feature tests; they're causing more headache than helping

Next steps: Figure out the cause of this.
Possible causes are
- Poorly written tests
- Zuora sandbox is shaky - either the system or conflicting because of shared credentials.
- Our project is shaky (I really hope this isn’t the case)

Go through this checklist https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/flaky_tests.html

There are some places in the codebase (see list below) that define custom log rotation policies.  There may be others as well.
*  [upgrade_subscription_plan_service.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/hosted_plans/upgrade_subscription_plan_service.rb#L10)

[More info on this topic can be found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/379#note_192191916).

### Proposal
Remove this logic from the code and rely on Linux log rotation tools.  This will likely involve changes to server setup/cookbooks.

### Problem
~~The credentials used in the pipeline and are recommended for use in [our README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/tree/staging#setup-commands) are the same.~~ Not the case actually: however they are being used locally by some developers.

This could be a factor in conflicting Zuora credentials causing specs to randomly fail https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/456#note_216365165

### Proposal
Rotate the credentials used in our pipelines.

1. Rotate the [CI Pipelines](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/HostedPageLite.do?method=preview&id=2c92c0f85b1ab29a015b34a60fb22f52) credentials
1. Update ENV variables on CI
1. Update Zuora details in `config/secrets.yml.example`
1. Don't hand `zuora_cc_payment_page_id` and CI API credentials out.

Less flaky feature tests.

### Problem
*  EULAS are either not being sent out or being sent out to the wrong individuals. Since these emails are not sent to out SFDC instance as well Reps have no idea who, when or if the EULAs were sent out.
### Proposal
*  Version 1 - have all EULA messages BCC our SFDC instance so that they get logged in on our records
### Result
*  This will reduce the pings coming from the field to SalesOps about EULAS being sent out
*  Decreased confusion in the field after they close a deal 
### Next steps (if any)
* [ ] The goal would be to BCC EULAs to our SFDC instance so that Sales Reps can see if they were sent out and if so to what email address
* [ ] Would we be able to alter how EULAs are sent out to BCC our SFDC instance while also keeping our BCC email address private? 
* [ ] We would want our BCC address private so that people can not find it and send emails directly into our SFDC instance 
* [ ] [Update the Customer Mailer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/master/app/mailers/customer_mailer.rb) - to send to our SFDC instance. I believe that is the only edit that would be required but will leave to the trusted hands of our developers to determine the final scope

24619159,2019-09-10 01:53:19.113,Buying CI minutes for any namespace should never unassociate the paid tier subscription,"### Problem

When a group is subscribed to a paid tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold) on GitLab.com and has more billable users in the group on GitLab.com than is purchased in the subscription, when the user purchases additional CI minutes the following undesired behavior occurs -  

1. A new subscription is created for the CI minutes instead of the minutes being associated with the existing paid subscription. 
2. The group association to the previously purchase subscription (Bronze, Silver, Gold) is removed and the subscription is orphaned. 

### Steps to recreate

1. Create a group in GitLab.com
1. Purchase a subscription for any paid tier on GitLab.com for any number of users
1. Add more billable users to the GitLab.com group than the number of users allotted in the subscription
1. Purchase Additional CI minutes by:
    1. Navigate to group's **Settings>Usage Quotas**
    1. Select **Buy additional minutes**
    1. Follow the purchase process to buy any amount of additional minutes
1. BUG1: A new subscription is created for the CI minutes instead of the minutes being associated with the existing paid subscription 
2. BUG2: The group association to the previously purchase subscription (Bronze, Silver, Gold) is removed and the subscription is orphaned. 

### Proposal

During the purchase of additional CI minutes (Step 4.3 above) in a use case like this, provide the user notice that the group's number of billable users exceeds its purchased user amount and provide option to pay for those users along with the additional CI minutes.

### Example Screenshots

![Customers_portal](/uploads/5b71d15d89b827a8013d90d7444a3d91/Customers_portal.png)

### Current ""workaround""

1. Ask user if we can charge the card on their behalf for the additional users.
1. Change the namespace to ""free"" in Gitlab.com admin
1. Try associating the namespace with the subscription in the customers portal
1. If the system is charging for all users and not crediting for the previously paid users, create an SE issue to see if there is a conflict causing this
1. If the system correctly applies the credit, complete the purchase

24477799,2019-09-05 03:26:49.705,[Portal Pajamas] Convert Layout to Pajamas SCSS,"### Problem
Customers.gitlab.com layout design doesn't match gitlab.com

### Proposal

Use the SCSS from gitlab.com/pajamas to update the design of the layout and typography to be similar to Gitlab.com. This should be done under the supervision of the design team.  

This does not include implementing individual controls in Vue.js. 

### Result

customers.gitlab.com look and feel more closely resembles gitlab.com. This the first step in moving to the standard Design System.

### How will we measure success?

Customers.gitlab.com more closely resembles gitlab.com

- [x] Read through bootstraps docs on migrating v3 to v4 and migrate

### Problem

Showing the coupon code field when we don't give out coupons is misleading and may distract customers from the purchase flow if they decide to google for a discount coupon. We need to use the coupon field for testing sometimes, so being able to access it still would be preferable, we just need to somehow hide it from customers who are making a purchase.

### Proposal

Some options:

1. Hide the coupon field on production and only show for dev/staging instances.
2. Hide the coupon field behind a URL, and document how to access the URL for testing purposes.
3. Suggestions welcome.

Make sure this is properly communicated with the sales team. 

We should also ensure that a CC is not required when adding a coupon. This is a current bug with the purchase flow when adding coupons.

24467162,2019-09-04 16:10:51.180,"Create a license key if one does not exist during ""Download License""","### Problem
Sometimes licenses have not been created in the license-app by the time a user attempts to download the license from the customers-app.  This leads to a `LicenseNotFoundError` and the user is shown an error message.

This cannot be worked on until #658 is complete.

### Proposal
If the license key was not created on the license-app, a better user experience could be for the license to be created in real-time. The workflow to retrieve the license key from the portal would be:
1.  Look for an existing license key based on the `subscription name`.
1. If result is empty, check to make sure a license was successfully paid for. 
1. If it was successfully paid for, create a new license key based on the subscription info from the portal.
1. Else, display an error message? Copy tbd

24466987,2019-09-04 16:01:53.212,Find licenses using subscription name,"### Problem
We currently lookup licenses for the ""Download License"" feature from the license-app using 4 attributes (`email`, `plan_code`, `users_count`, and `expires_at`).  This link between the two systems seems a bit flimsy.

### Proposal
On the license app, add a new column to store the `subscription name`. We may need to create a script that contacts the Zuora API and obtains the `subscription name` based on the `subscription id` that we've stored on the license app. Once this is ready on the license app, we can just find by the `subscription name` instead of using all the 4 fields listed above.

This was [originally proposed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/281#note_188242848) by Rubén in #281.  This issue also relates to #636.

### Result
A cleaner link between the subscription in the customers-app and the license in the license-app.

### Next steps (if any)
Once this is in place, the customers-app can request a license to be created if it does not yet exist in the license-app.

24397671,2019-09-02 20:02:10.743,Adding Zuora and Salesforce IDs to another user breaks upgrade,"## Summary

When a user requests access to manage the subscription in the customers portal in addition to or instead of another user, we (in support) will copy/remove the Zuora and SFDC ids from the Edit page in the customers portal from the existing user and add to the requesting user (after they fulfill security criteria).

When we do this, the subscription of the additional/new user appears without being linked in the Manage Purchase page. 

* Not only does this cause confusion to the user, but the `upgrade` button is no longer present in the customers portal as a result
* When the user attempts to upgrade via the button within GitLab.com group>billing page, they are not able to due to [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/652)

Is there a workaround to add/change the customers portal contact for a subscription without causing these issues?

This error happens because the rails_helper.rb loads rails, which loads the config/initializers. This eventually loads the zuora.rb initializer and [tries to `eager_load` Plans here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/894d8c5c1cde3ae771ec1c41008f2f2ecddd2b1d/config/initializers/zuora.rb#L84). This fails because the `ZUORA_API_USER` and `ZUORA_API_PASSWORD` environment variables are not set (or really the secrets file doesn't have `zuora_api_user` and `zuora_api_password` set in the test section).

More info can be found in #645.

### Proposal
We could look into stubbing the `PlansFinder.eager_load` or maybe disable that part of the initializer in the test environment.

### Result
It would great to remove this dependency for multiple reasons:
- Simplifies the process for getting your test suite running locally.
- A big step towards being able to run the test suite without being connected to the internet.

23356621,2019-07-31 16:11:53.936,Prefer `Date.current` & `Time.current` over `Date.today` & `Time.now`,"### Problem
In various places in the app code, there are references to `Date.today` and `Time.now` which works but isn't as accurate as `Date.current` and `Time.current` which uses Rails timezone configuration (UTC in our case) instead of using the system configured time.  This could vary by installation, causing some tests to fail locally on one system but pass on another causing confusion and inconsistency.  [See this for more information](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/its-about-time-zones).

### Proposal
Change instances of:
- `Date.today` to `Date.current`
- `Time.now` to `Time.current`

Things like `10.hours.ago` and `5.days.from_now` [should already be using `Time.current`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v4.2.6/activesupport/lib/active_support/duration.rb#L108).

### Problem

We are integrating more tightly the customer portal into GitLab EE, and it means that more GitLab.com only code will end up there, potentially increasing the leakage to self-manage.

This is a corrective action from the RCA: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/issues/34

### Proposal

A few ideas could be:

1. Add a Danger warning when touching specific SaaS code
1. Add a checkbox in the MR to make sure we double-check we are guarding against this
1. Abstract and extract specific code so it is easier to put a high-level check or some sort of gateway to check for `.com?`
1. Extract this code into a Gem, engine, or different service, easier to include/exclude depending on being a `.com?` feature
1. Keep this code in the customer's app, focusing on a transparent transition to the customer (from `.com?` to the customer portal, they will appear the same).

### Result

More safety towards this kind of bugs, or total prevention

### Next steps (if any)

Gather more ideas and agree on one or more in order to prevent the leakage situation

I think will be useful to provide this option from the admin panel or by trying to improve the impersonate feature and detect when it's in use and enable features only when an admin is impersonating a customer account.

### Approach

* When impersonating a customer on a paid plan, allow downgrading of a user's plan to any lower tier.
  * The account downgrade should not go into effect until their paid period has expired at the higher tier. If a user pays for a year of Bronze, they should receive 100% of that paid year (even if they downgrade after 6 months).

8146411,2017-12-11 11:27:51.870,Ability to perform sales-assisted purchases,"### Background

Currently, the only way to easily purchase a subscription on GitLab.com is to have a user who is a member of the group login to customers.gitlab.com and provide their credit card information. Customers.gitlab.com is then responsible for making API calls to Zuora, Salesforce and GitLab.com to update billing information.

Sales can, however, be processed via purchase order, either directly with GitLab sales or via partner resellers. This is currently a manual process that involves impersonation of a valid user on customers.gitlab.com.

### Proposal

1. After the order is processed and paid, the user should be sent an email explaining what they need to do:
  * The email should contain a link to set their password on customers.gitlab.com
  * The user then needs to choose the group to apply their payment to
  * If possible, the email should contain screenshots with an example",3
7061992,2017-10-03 15:18:16.078,Trials for GitLab.com plans,"## Background 

We need to allow our users and salespeople to trial GitLab.com plans for 30 days.

An initial simple solution is to allow a trial activation without a credit card.

## Proposal

1. Allow users to visit GitLab.com plan pages (https://gitlab.com/profile/billings or https://gitlab.com/groups/GROUPNAME/-/billings) and activate a trial.
2. A user should have the option of starting a 30-day Gold trial.
3. On clicking on the trial CTA, a form similar to the free trial form (https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/) should be displayed to capture lead information, which is pushed to SF.
4. On submitting the form, the trial is activated. A user should be redirected to the billing page and see a banner notifying them that they're on a Gold trial, and when this trial expires. This banner should persist until the trial expires.
5. After 30 days, the trial is deactivated. The trial option should no longer be presented on the billing page, and a user should not be able to obtain another trial for a user or group that's had a trial before.

During the trial, users should receive a nurture campaign similar to our existing campaign for self-managed trials.

A user should also be able to upgrade their account to a paid account during the trial. 

## Open questions

* Are we doing trials at each subscription level?

No. The trial is for Gold only.

* Are we allowing trials for individuals, groups, or both?

Both. Accounts should get 1 trial, which can be applied to a personal namespace or a group.

* Should we change `pricing` and consider a separate flow for a new, unregistered user?

Yes, in a separate issue. This should only apply to existing users. 

* How does nurture messaging from Marketo and Outreach fit in?

TBD.

* How will the new form interface with SFDC?

We should push these leads to SFDC in the same way we do in https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/, in the new free trial form. We should note that these leads are for .com.",4

When we implement [Quarterly Self-Managed Seat Reconciliation & Billing](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2747), users will not be aware of the need to load a new license unless we alert them.

### Implementation

1. Starting at ""quarterly event' - 7 days, do a daily check to see if the customer will require an add-on
1. Where yes, expose a banner in the instance UI (not portal) to admins only 
1. The banner should contain the following information:
     1. Link to docs page re: quarterly user reconciliation
     1. Importance of applying the updated license when it is received
     1. How to contact us for help
     1. The banner should be dismissible
     1. If the admin blocks enough users to get back under their subscription seat count, then the banner should be removed
1. Display a second banner after the quarterly seat reconciliation has been processed (and the new license is available)
     1. This banner should **not** be dismissible
     1. The banner should be removed upon applying the license
          Options:
          1. Any new license
          1. A license which has more users than previous count

We should not display this message to air-gapped, closed network, or prior to us starting to actually process these charges.

### Problem

The initial designs in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/679 show a summation of seats for subscriptions.

However this data isn't currently available from the backend: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/1126 and making these calculations in the UI is error-prone; the worst thing we can do is show incorrect data.

31517177,2020-03-03 18:39:24.800,Preload of Plans prevents Auto DevOps image build,"### Problem

The application preloads the plans during the initialization phase.  This phase is run during `pre-compile assets` when building an image for Auto DevOps.  Unfortunately, when the image is being built there is no environment. The image hasn't been deployed to production, staging, or a review app yet.  This causes the build to fail.

The specific piece of code causing the failure is this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/config/application.rb#L65
```ruby
# Load all the plans from Zuora and initialize Plan model in an instance variable.
# Avoid load in test environment as the call from Zuora is been preloaded via VCR cassette.
config.after_initialize do
  PlansFinder.eager_load unless Rails.env.test?
end
```
The failure happens in the `pre-compile assets` phase.  Here is an example: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/jobs/419644471#L830

```
D, [2020-01-29T23:28:23.810172 #2617] DEBUG -- : could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host ""127.0.0.1"" and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
excluded from capture: DSN not set
rake aborted!
PG::ConnectionBad: could not connect to server: Connection refused
Is the server running on host ""127.0.0.1"" and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```

This is expected at this point because the image is being built for any environment and is not yet deployed to any of them.  Anything which requires a database connection must happen later - outside of the `pre-compile assets` phase. Specifically, the initializers are run during the `pre-compile assets` phase.

### Proposal

[This test commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/525/diffs?diff_id=75038595&start_sha=e163aa1414572313a8deeeb61f326c61c4c09f76) fixes the problem and allows the image to be built and the application to start up.  However, since the plans are no longer pre-loaded, the app throws an error when accessing the login page.

I'm proposing moving this code to a more appropriate place rather than deleting it.  Perhaps it can be run on first use, or at some other time after the application has already started up.

I was unable to find a way to leave it where it is but wrap it in a conditional which would cause it to not run during an image build but run during normal app startup.  If anyone has an idea how to do that, it could be an alternate solution.

### Result

The result should be that no database connections should happen during the `pre-compile assets` phase of the image build.  However, the plans must be loaded when a user connects to the login page.

### Next steps (if any)

The next step is to get some ideas for the best way to do this, and discuss the best one.  At that point, we should create an MR against the default branch to implement that idea, and also test the change in the review branch here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/525 

### How will we measure success?

If the image can successfully build, deploy, and start up, and the user facing functionality of the application is unchanged (the login page displays without errors), then this change will be successful.

### Problem

While working on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/679 we want to show purchases and seats in the UI.

This becomes a problem when a subscription

* Self-Managed and has a true-up 
* GitLab.com and users have been added to the group

Since this data isn't exposed by the backend, we'd need to make these calculations in the UI. Previously this wasn't a problem since the UI listed individual purchases, and did not add the total up.

### Proposal

Design and implement a `/subscriptions` endpoint with a clear contract of what data is available.
Possibly this could be done with graphql: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/889 but that's a stretch-goal.

Alternatively [`subscription_presenter`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/presenters/subscription_presenter.rb) can be augmented with the required information.

In any case, this is calculating seats purchased and seats used; so it's a non-trivial product effect here.

### Result

We can trust that data in the UI accurately reflects the correct data",5

Navigating to new subscription as anonymous user throws 500 error, e.g. https://customers.stg.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92c0f9699eca030169a2f1f117045f&subscription_id=A-S00006613&transaction=ci_minutes

**NOTE:** This doesn't happen on production. On production it redirects you to `https://customers.gitlab.com/plans`

### Steps to reproduce

1. Try to open [this URL](https://customers.stg.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92c0f9699eca030169a2f1f117045f&subscription_id=A-S00006613&transaction=ci_minutes) as anonymouse user.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Application throws 500 error.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should show a screen with sign in to GitLab.com

> the plans handling in Gitlab.com and in customers.gitlab.com is a bit confusing including `null` plans. I think we're fine with the current MR's scope. But I feel like we need a bigger overhaul going forward across the two applications.

It becomes awkward to handle free plans, since we're marking the absence of information (`null`) as a Free Plan.

A `null` plan can also happen if a bug happens, so it might be risky to fall back to Free Plan like this.

Find a strategy for handling free plans across GitLab core and Customer Portal.

* Could be actively marking Free Plans (serialize Free Plan as a product)
* Could be embracing `null` == Free Plan in the Customer Portal at the data layer.",2

### Problem 
Often, when a subscription is refunded customers are unable to purchase again until we clear out the old `Order` object by setting the `subscription_id` and `product_rate_plan_id` to `nil`.

See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/dotcom/dotcom-internal/issues/1663

Best guess as to how to reproduce:
- Purchase a new subscription
- Ask for a refund
- Attempt to re-purchase

### Proposal :pencil: 

@vshumilo writes: 

Based on the referenced tickets this happens in two main scenarios
1. The subscription is cancelled and the customer is not able tu purchase another subscription for the same group
1. The subscription is refunded and the customer is not able tu purchase CI minutes for it.

In order to address this, we will fix it in two separate MRs that correspond to the scenarios described above.

The main reason is that for the first scenario :one: the subscription portal currently listens for subscription callouts, so when a subscription is cancelled on the Zuora end we will get the callout and process it accordingly making it straightforward to recreate the fix.

For the second scenario :two: 
- A new `refund` endpoint needs to be created in the subscription portal
- Some `refund callouts` need to be configured on the Zuora Payment Notifications end
- Some questions need to be asked / answered to clarify the current refund process to establish what are the Zuora callouts we want to configure for refunds out of the available options (please see next section).
- Some investigation is in progress to establish how to get a Zuora Subscription based o a Zuora Refund
- Refunds and maybe some other objects need to be defined wihin the Subscription Portal to serve as an interface with the Zuora api. Ex: Refund is not one of the resources provided by IronBank

Based on this, we want to ship :ship: these scenarios separately to:
1. Deliver value in small incremental bits 
1. So the first part is not conditioned by the unknowns we have for the second

### Things we need to answer :question: 

1. What is the process to add a new callout to Zuora in Production mode
1. What are the current refunds that we handle, the 4 types available within Zuora notifications are:
    1. `Credit Balance Refund Processed | Credit Balance Refund Processed`
    1. `Credit Balance Refund Processed | External Credit Balance Refund Processed`
    1. `Payment Refund Processed | External Payment Refund Processed`
    1. `Payment Refund Processed | Payment Refund Processed`
1. How to get from the parameters available in the Zuora Refund (Payments scope) to the Zuora Subscription to be able to map the refund to an existing order (In Progress by @vshumilo)
1. How to get the type of Refund so we can differentiate between primary and secondary subscriptions (do not clear the subscription for the order if the refund is for ci minutes) (In Progress by @vshumilo)

### Thank you!

Shoutout to @rdavila for an awesome collaboration :handshake: and taking the time to talk through the challenges for the new endpoint and adding so much value and insight.

30165778,2020-01-31 18:19:50.558,Consider enabling eager loading in dev and/or test environments,"### Problem
In [a recent discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/972#note_280295821) in !972, @oswaldo raised a valid point about enabling eager loading in the dev and/or test environments to avoid a bug where some `Zuora::` namespaced classes have not been loaded.  In the interest of fixing that particular bug quickly to avoid CI errors, we decided to move forward with the solution of using `const_get(resource_name, false)`. See !972 for more information on the specific error and solution.

### Proposal
Another potential solution would be to enable eager loading in Rails which would ensure those Zuora classes (and others) are loaded just as they are in Production.  It's worth considering the implications of enabling this setting in both environments.  A potential downside is the longer boot time in Rails but it might not be prohibitive.  Part of this issue should be reaching out to the team for consensus on this topic.  For perspective, the GitLab code base eager loads in the test environment but not development.

All classes are loaded up front which is more consistent with Production usage.

When the above setting is turned on, the build proceeds.


### Proposal

In order to use Auto Devops, we need to do one of the following:

- Decide that the risk is acceptable and enable the registry
- Take the project private so that the registry is private, and enable the registry
- Implement more granular permissions on the registry and enable it

This open issue regarding registry permissions is 3 years old: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/878

There is also one regarding private/public registries: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/19585

### Result

Somehow, the registry will need to be on for Auto Devops to be enabled.

### Next steps (if any)

Temporarily enabling the registry results in Auto-Devops working, so we know that turning it on will unblock the Auto-Devops work.  We just need to decide how we are going to do that.",0

Our team in Customer Enablement is looking to roll out some additional customer training options. Here is the info of their request: 

Requesting a set of new SKUs that will be remote live and on-demand virtual classroom instructor-led trainings delivered via Zoom Webinars. These SKUs will be priced per individual user. Users will pay using a credit card through the Customers.GitLab.com portal which will give them access to the course registration page. The Fulfillment team will be added to this issue to work on building a connector to the Zoom Webinar registration pages for each session after the payment is processed.

## Requirements: 
* Able to be purchased via credit card in the customers portal 
*  On the main customer portal page at customers.gitlab.com, add an option to the bottom of the page after ""Purchase CI minutes."" The heading would say ""Sign up for a course"" and we'd list the different courses there. 
* The fields we need to collect in the Customers Portal, in addition to those required to process a payment, are: 
  * First name (required)
  * Last name (required)
  * Email address (required)
  * Organization (required text field)
  * Role (Required drop down select -- Developer, system administrator, product manager, engineering lead, project manager, security specialist, other)
  * gitlab.com username (optional text field)
* Post-purchase, direct the customer to the Zoom webinar registration page and pass the fields noted above, as well as the purchase information, so they are pre-populated on the Zoom registration page 
* The way an individual receives a GitLab purchase receipt should be consistent with how it is done for a GitLab license purchase

That being said, the main code smell comes from the `instance variables` of `module ZuoraTestHelpers`. So the ultimate goal is to eliminate all instance variables from `ZuoraTestHelpers`.

But this issue will limit the scope to be: add the FactoryBot for Zuora account, and use the factoryBot in `some` of the specs. 

To achieve the ultimate goal of `removing all instance variables from ZuoraTestHelpers`, it requires lots of specs to re-run VCR re-recording. Due to the complexity and effort is non-trivial, we will avoid this part in this issue. We leave the ultimate goal in another follow-up issue [Remove instance variables from spec/support/helpers/zuora_test_helpers.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2306) for the next step.  BTW: with the MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2229 , we could already remove all `destroy_zuora_records` from `ALL` specs, per https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2229#note_468181231. But this is not urgent. And it will naturally happen in issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2306 anyway.",3

29716362,2020-01-17 22:54:54.886,Subscription adjustment buttons should not be offered when the subscription is expired.,"### Problem
Once a subscription expires, there is a short period (maybe 24 hours - need to check with AR), where a user can still renew and the card will try to process the payment. After that short period, if a user tries to renew using the ""Resume Subscription"" button or ""Auto Renew"" toggle, the renewal will not process. Offering this button to users after expiration is confusing.

In some cases the subscription does appear active after these actions but the user is never billed.

Additionally, there is a timeframe that when the customer reengages after ""x"" days post-renewal date, they become a ""new"" order rather than a ""renewal"" order. We should obtain how sales defines and align the behavior.

### Proposal

Remove all buttons beneath an expired subscription including ""Resume Subscription"", ""Change linked group"", and ""Buy more CI minutes"" from the subscription widget once the subscription is expired. This applies to both .com and self-managed subscriptions/licenses.

NOTE: We're only doing this in the new Pajamas (vue) interface.

This is a follow-up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/865.

### Problem

The admin table is too congested.


### Proposal

@timnoah [said in the main issue's MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/858#note_269208798):

> As this is quite a congested table to relieve some of the pressure on wrapping headers could we change the date formatting on **created at** and **updated at** to `MM DD, YYYY hh:mm` Example, **Dec 20, 2019 15:34**?

@aalakkad said: 

> I'm not sure how easy it is to do that in rails_admin, for a quick search I found [a way](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32631342) to configure the date format, but I can't be sure if it has any implications for other parts of the system.


### Result

Comfortable tables in the admin panel.

### Next steps (if any)

Validate the issue and schedule.

29447215,2020-01-09 15:06:19.714,Update Zuora Sandbox creds for CI and customers.stg.gitlab.com to use an API account,"### Problem
It appears that we routinely (every 6 months?) have to update the Zuora API Sandbox password which is used for CI and for customers.stg.gitlab.com.  In the past, when we've updated these creds, there is confusion around the process as well as downtime in the CI Pipeline and at customers.stg.gitlab.com.  This can cause delays in deploys while the infrastructure team updates the password in the chef-vault.

More info can be found in [the Slack thread discussion](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1578582393061900?thread_ts=1578566280.044100&cid=CMJ8JR0RH).
### Proposal
We should update the Zuora sandbox credentials used for CI and staging to be an ""API account"" so that the credentials never expire and we don't have to update them routinely.

### Result
No downtime in CI and staging as a result of expired credentials.

29362569,2020-01-07 10:06:21.098,Add backtrace to gitlab logger when error type is Error,"### Problem

Currently when a log_error is called with the error object the Raven is called with `capture_exception` and the error is send as an inspect of the error object. 

### Proposal

When calling [Raven.capture_exception](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-ruby/blob/ad440b952de0f62b62c42433882887c2cb678caf/lib/raven/event.rb#L181), the method checks itself whether the parameter is a exception or a string and will add backtrace if exists.

 Call `message = message.is_a?(String) ? message : message.inspect` after `Raven.capture_exception(message, extra: extra)` 

### Result

This will help in backtrace all the custom exceptions raised by the application.

### Problem

There are conflicting colors between our project and the pajamas.

In our `variables.scss` we have:

```scss
$gray-400: #444;
$gray-500: #a1a1a2;
$gray-600: #d2d2d2;
$gray-700: #fafafa;
$gray-800: #dfdfdf;
$gray-900: #707070;
```

In pajamas `variables.scss`:

```scss
$gray-400: #bababa;
$gray-500: #a7a7a7;
$gray-600: #919191;
$gray-700: #707070;
$gray-800: #4f4f4f;
$gray-900: #2e2e2e;
```

### Proposal

Unify the colors code in our project so we will follow the same color convention as pajamas.

Which will need careful changing in our stylesheets that use any of the `$gray-*` variables.

### Result

### Next steps (if any)

- [ ] Validate proposal.
- [ ] Schedule the issue.

- [x] @tyleramos started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/806#note_266198562):  (+3 comments)

### Problem

### Proposal

Upgrade Bundler to 2.1.2: `gem update bundle && bundle update --bundler`

### Result

* No more this warning

### Next steps (if any)

### Problem
Because we're using `.find` in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/953786c214559b2562506c8809a8416e4a9ac77e/app/views/rails_admin/main/list_gitlab_namespaces.html.haml#L29 and not doing any further processing, we're reading a `quantity` from something that may, or may not, be a license count in accounts with multiple `Order` objects.

See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/dotcom/dotcom-internal/issues/1302 for an example.

### Proposal
Correctly determine the number of license seats by either:
- querying the group on GitLab.com directly (this count is usually right)
- be potentially inaccurate in a different way (e.g. `max` of the quantity in all the orders)
- add a check that the `Order` returned has the right type of subscription for the quantity to make sense in this context
- ... something else?

28956710,2019-12-20 16:36:55.286,Remove legacy license retrieval logic,"### Problem
As part of #658, we introduced new logic to the customers-app and license-app to retrieve licenses using the `zuora_subscription_name`.  The logic in the customers-app is behind a feature flag `license_lookup_by_subscription_name`.  Once we've verified that the new logic is working well, there is no need to keep the old logic.

### Proposal
- [x]  Verify the new logic is working as intended.
- [x] Create an MR in the customers-app to remove the old retrieval logic and remove the references to the `license_lookup_by_subscription_name` feature flag.  Reference !818 for more information.  This is the MR where the new logic was introduced.

    > I'd honestly be ok leaving the `find` method as is, but we could implement a `find_by` method on `Zuora::Resource`.  This would be similar to the `active_find_by` on `Zuora::Subscription` (without the additional active condition).  So if we didn't want an error thrown, we could use something like `Zuora::Account.find_by(id: id)` which would be consistent with Rails.  WDYT?

As part of this work, we could review the codebase to look for places where the new `find_by` method could be used instead of `where().first`.  Also, if we implement a `find_by!` method, similar to [the `active_find_by!` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/87b0228b135dca04a53e151307fcdbb9cb5ba37c/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L18), which throws a `Zuora::RecordNotFound` error, we could clean up the implementation in a few places.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2816 the fallback to the contact in case the customer's `salesforce_account_id` is empty was evaluated along the way and it resulted in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2816#note_512834833). **TLDR:** it might be a good idea to update the customer's `salesforce_account_id` in case there was a fallback to the contact (this can be an existing one or even a newly created one). So here's the issue to suggest this:

When looking for the Salesforce account id of a customer and the `salesforce_account_id` field is empty, there is a fallback to the Salesforce contact in place ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/b9203079a4bf620a915c46eca0b9012842dfdccd/app/services/create_salesforce_account_service.rb#L32)). But the customer object is not updated with that information in case the contact returns it.

This is also the case when creating a new contact as a fallback in the [Salesforce::BaseOpportunityService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b9203079a4bf620a915c46eca0b9012842dfdccd/app/services/salesforce/base_opportunity_service.rb#L29) that is used by `Salesforce::CreateOpportunityService` and `Salesforce::UpdateOpportunityService`.

`@jbrennan1` also [provided this information](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2816#note_515380804):

> a quick overview / thoughts on how SFDC Account, Contact, Opportunity and Opportunity Contact Roles all work:
>
> 1. Establish the SFDC Account Id that ALL of the remaining objects will relate up to. @cwiesner the improvement you made to make sure we are ensuring the Account Id is populated looks great! We need to make sure that all steps use the same Account Id.
> 1. Insert the Contact with AccountId = the Account's Id.
> 1. Insert the Opportunity with the AccountId = the Account's Id.
> 1. Insert the Opportunity Contact Role with OpportunityId = Inserted Opp's Id and ContactId = Inserted Contact's Id.
>
> Technically parts 2 and 3 can be switched in the order. Tell me if there are any more questions.

### Proposal
After falling back to the Salesforce contact when the customer's `salesforce_account_id` is empty, update it with the contact's `AccountId`.

### Result
Consistent data and less queries since the field will be updated.

`ZUORA_API_USER` and `ZUORA_API_PASSWORD` are environment variables that were used to authenticate with the Zuora SOAP API and a few other places that called the Zuora API directly.  With the removal of the Zuora SOAP API code in favor of the REST API using IronBank (which uses oAuth client credentials `ZUORA_CLIENT_ID` and `ZUORA_CLIENT_SECRET`), it appears we might be able to remove these environment variable if they are no longer used.

After the MR merges:
1. Send a reminder to the team via Slack letting them know to remove the envirionment variables from their `config/secrets.yml` file.

79655929,2021-02-23 17:55:55.016,[FE] Breakdown: Community subscriptions should be able to self-checkout renewals,"## Summary 

In https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5068 we are building self-service checkout of new community program subscription. We now need to build a renewal flow for these subscribers.

The general process flow described in the parent epic is the same for new and renewal subscriptions however when the user enters CustomersDot, they will need to select a `Renew` cta.

## Development plan
* Build landing page for CE renewal https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3601
  * add a new route `/subscriptions/community_program/renew`
  * re-use templates that we build for CE subscription `community_subscription_landing_page.vue`
* Update the CE subscription cards on `/subscriptions` page
  * Add info banner for renewal alert that would show up 3 month before before expiration https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3574
  * enable renew buttons with correct path https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3575
* Build a renewal page for CE
  * add a new route `/subscriptions/community_program/renew/A-SXXXXXX` with basic titles https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3576
  * add purchase description https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3577
    * mind that we need two different versions of it: for SaaS and for SelfManaged
    * for SelfManaged version add a collapsible element with a hint from [subscription_renew.vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a8d38ed9bd91be182e6288ff341a0c736713788f/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/subscription_renew.vue#L337). We already have this element glued in the `subscripton_renew` component so it is a good time to extract it and use in two places
  * add customer information [component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/76db4040e6294daa2da5ae813f667c54d34781a5/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/customer_information.vue) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3578
  * add coupon input [component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fa85e92d41afbdd97d324d6a4a37f0cba16529e5/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/coupon_code_input.vue) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3602
  * add purchase confirmation [component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/f86054a4cb83d5536a2f5093830b4b47d7a55ff0/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/purchase_confirmation_card.vue) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3603
  * show success message if transaction is successful [modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/75adc85589a351f9aa523a4ca2f1bd46e7c3d09a/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/purchase_success_modal.vue) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3604
    * We would also need two version here for SaaS and for Selfmanaged

### Problem

We currently require `rspec-parameterized` [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/6e5df55d8add9945f2c9348263511d1c30098362/spec/spec_helper.rb#L6), which means we don't need to require it inline in specs when not using the table syntax, e.g.

```ruby
using RSpec::Parameterized::TableSyntax
```

So we should consider refactoring existing uses of the above (or removing the global require)

78930301,2021-02-11 18:27:23.367,Invalid user input during purchase should not raise Sentry errors,"### Problem

We've seen some Sentry errors (shown below) which were triggered from invalid user input like entering an invalid quantity during a EoA upgrade at renewal.  These types of errors are displayed on the page in order for the user to fix the problem on their own.  They don't represent an error in the code that needs to be addressed so we should not raise these types of errors in Sentry, which adds extra noise.

1. [You have exceeded the 25 seat allowance for this offer](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/2486996/?referrer=slack)

### Proposal

These errors are handled in [the `AmendSubscriptionService#execute` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e390ecbe3fde96d1747056b9bd3f05c88958aac9/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L35).  Some errors (`PaymentMethodUpdateError`, `NotUpgradableError`, `NotDowngradableError`, `MaxAdditionalSeatsExceededError`) are rescued without logging an error to Sentry.  

The first error above (`MaxAdditionalSeatsExceededError`; [raised here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/eaedf03b86463244a458f9bf1d63c3fe9424d0ea/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L262)) should be handled this way without logging in Sentry but it must be somehow.  This might be coming from the frontend as errors are raised [from here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e3560a9d6787bf155672380f7b3a9da5ff00928b/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/upgrade_subscription_app.vue#L238) as well.

The second error ([raised here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e390ecbe3fde96d1747056b9bd3f05c88958aac9/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L245) is logged to Sentry because it's raised as a `RenewalError` which [rescued here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e390ecbe3fde96d1747056b9bd3f05c88958aac9/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L36) and logged to Sentry.

78739218,2021-02-09 17:32:55.884,Remove custom eager loading in PlansFinder is possible,"### Problem

In the `PlansFinder` currently, plans are eager loaded during [app initialization](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/13b85a3f5e28800634da970972c3bc5313b2d37c/config/application.rb#L72).  This is done as an optimization to reduce the number of requests to Zuora to fetch common products from the catalog.  However, now that we are using [IronBank's local products cache feature](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank#local-records) (with a slight [customization to store in the db](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/45f5dedbb4fa803d19827472214ea0b5b0ce1861/lib/gem_extensions/iron_bank/local_records.rb#L6) instead of filesystem), we might not need this eager-loading mechanism anymore.

Removing eager loading would have some nice benefits:
- Removes complexity in the app loading logic.
- Removes a few [class variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L12) from our codebase which in general should be avoided.
- Removes the [eager-loading step](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fe13e488edc07ced567e0b64d6b560b83b2ccf0d/spec/support/eager_load_plan_finder.rb#L10) from Rspec configuration.  This would be a huge benefit because `plans_finder` has its own VCR cassette for this eager loading that frequently causes merge conflicts since it is a very commonly updated file.  Fixing this should improve our velocity and generally the engineers quality of life.

### Proposal

Remove the `PlansFinder` eager-loading logic and make sure nothing breaks.  The `PlansFinder.find` method could be updated to find a Product Rate Plan directly using IronBank (e.g. `Zuora::ProductRatePlan.find`) rather than looping over `eager_loaded_plans`.  The key difference here is we would build the `Plan` object on the fly instead of returning a `Plan` object that was [built during start up](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/aa13252af0a6e69a58c8ac2bc645afaf36d7b12c/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L31).

We should take benchmarks of important features before and after this change to make sure there is no negative impact.  Here are some ideas of things to benchmark:
- Loading the Rails app.
- Loading the Plans page.
- Loading the Manage subscriptions page.
- Making a subscription purchase.

### Result

A simpler codebase that hopefully isn't any less performant but easier to maintain.",5

### Problem

slack discussion https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1612432937066900

TLDR: When a namespace has a free trial and then purchased a paid plan, it will have this issue.

The problem is: in `app/helpers/gitlab_plans_helper.rb`, it uses `namespace.trial_ends_on.nil?` to determine whether a subscription is `in trial`. This is not safe.

**Snapshot (some namespace with paid subscriptions like g300, is allowing to link to another subscription, which is wrong)** ![Screenshot_from_2021-02-08_09-46-05](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/uploads/1f399fa44f70f1edd5fda900fed8efe6/Screenshot_from_2021-02-08_09-46-05.png)

### Proposal

TLDR: uses `!namespace.trial` to replace `namespace.trial_ends_on.nil?` in `app/helpers/gitlab_plans_helper.rb`

**More details explained below**

The information we saved for trial subscription:

* trial_starts_on
* trial
* trial_ends_on.

It is not safe to use `trial_ends_on` to determine whether a subscription is `in trial`. Because when a trial finished, `trial_ends_on` value is not cleared.

Scenarios related to `trial subscription`:

1. in active trial: `trial = true`, `trial_starts_on <= today`, `trial_ends_on >= today`
1. trial expired: `trial = true`, `trial_starts_on <= today`, `trial_ends_on < today`
1. trial terminated due to a paid subscription purchased: `trial = false`, `trial_starts_on <= today`, `trial_ends_on has value ( it >= date when trial was terminated; but while time flies, it will < today eventually)`
1. trial expired, and then a paid subscription purchased: `trial = false`, `trial_starts_on <= today`, `trial_ends_on < today`

From the above-listed scenarios:

* if a namespace's latest subscription is `trial`, it has `trial = true`, no matter the trial expired or not
* if a namespace's latest subscription is a paid subscription, it has `trial = false`

**NOTE**: today, even when a namespace's trial expired, we still show it as `Trial` in GUI, though the Gold features are disabled since we checked `trial_ends_on` in the logic.

From another perspective, in our code logic, as of today, there are 3 types namespaces:

* free : not link to a subscription, no matter trial subscription or paid subscription
* trial : link to trial subscription(it can be active or expired), but not link to a paid subscription
* paid subscription : link to a paid subscription

So if a namespace is linked to a subscription, we can use `trial` to determine it is trial subscripton or paid subscription.

### Summary

- Given a customer with a self-managed subscription 
- And a valid license in license.gitlab.com
- When I click on download license on the subscription card in customers.gitlab.com
- Then I am redirected to `https://customers.gitlab.com/licenses/CCV%20Group%20B.V.-%2035%20Starter`
- And I see a 404 error with the following text: 

```
This customers.gitlab.com page can’t be found
No web page was found for the web address: https://customers.gitlab.com/licenses/CCV%20Group%20B.V.-%2035%20Starter

- Given a customer with a self-managed subscription 
- And a valid license in license.gitlab.com
- When I click on `Copy license to clipboard` on the subscription card in customers.gitlab.com
- An error appears in the bottom left corner of the screen, with text:
```
An error occurred, please try again later

### Problem

For new purchases of self-managed plans we currently use the URL schema

`https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=[PLAN_ID]&test=capabilities`

This means that external routes like [a subscribable in-app banner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2582) need to know the planId for the lowest tier in order to link to ""lowest possible purchase""

### Proposal

Add a route like `/subscriptions/new?lowest_tier_plan_for=[self_managed|saas]` which puts the responsibility of knowing the planId on CustomerDot. This way the consumers (in-app banners) have a static URL they can consume.",5

In #2618 we unified the terminology in the renew and upgrade pages.

### Proposal

Rename `yearly` to `annually` in:

- [x] `./app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/add_seats_invoice.vue`
- [x] `./app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/new_ee_subscription_form.vue`

78007784,2021-01-28 15:06:31.178,EoA: Cancelled subscription is not obvious,"## Summary

We no longer show the autorenew toggle/cancel button since we updated all Bronze/Starter to autocancel. This has increased user confusion (pre-existing issue) over how to cancel their subscription.

In the subscription header, it states the expiration date which implies it will cancel but I think we need something more eye-catching.

In this iteration, I'd like to ship a quick solution to the CustomersDot subscription card for subscriptions set to cancel. This should be applicable to all subscriptions which are not set to autorenew, not just Bronze/Starter.

Perhaps a colored badged that says ""cancelled"" and when you hover over it there is text along the lines of ""this subscription will not automatically renew and will cancel on the expiration date. Please select the renew button to continue your subscription for another year."" ... ish?

I'm totally open to alternative ideas, whatever it is, would be good to ship asap.

- When the customer has a current Starter subscription with trueups

# Q: I have a Bronze subscription and want to take this offer, however I'm blocked by this behaviour

You need to [Change the linked namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/#change-the-linked-namespace) to unblock yourself

1. Log in to the [Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in) with a linked GitLab.com account.
1. Navigate to the Manage Purchases page.
1. Select Change linked namespace.
1. Select the desired group from the This subscription is for dropdown.
1. Select Proceed to checkout. 

If this doesn't work see below :point_down: 

# Q: I tried to Change the linked namespace however my intended group is greyed out

Then it's a data-integrity issue. Quickest way to resolve this is to open [a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293)

# Development on UI bug

### Problem

![Screenshot_2021-01-27_at_08.22.34](/uploads/f14def69aa9eead0dbaec1cb878d3717/Screenshot_2021-01-27_at_08.22.34.png)

On the `/subscription` overview, we show the Upgrade offering for Bronze subscriptions.

However some subscriptions do not have namespaces associated with them, for example if the namespace was deleted.

### Proposal

Only show the upgrade offer banner if Subscription is associated and active. We can check this with `upgradeSubscriptionPath` for example.

### Result

We do not confuse our users with a banner prompting them to action and then they can't take action.

### Setting up local development for this case

### Problem

In our frontend [we look for a human-readable error to present to the user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c330e163096f2968413a4f76cd64c9c28ce248bf/app/frontend/javascripts/parse_responses.js#L15-26) so the user can correct what's erroring out if possible.

The format the frontend expects is

```
{ 
  gateway_response: ""Insufficient funds"" // this structure we inherit from Zuora
}

// OR
{
  errors : {
    message: ""Can't renew for less than current user count"",
    code: ""RENEW_COUNT_FAILURE"" // optional field if something special should be flagged on the frontend
  }
}

```

However we're not always following this structure. Below are instances of `{ error: ""Something went wrong"" }` in our codebase

```
~/workspace/customers-gitlab-com staging ⇣
❯ git grep ""render json: { error:""
app/controllers/application_controller.rb:        render json: { error: 'We were unable to process this transaction.' }, status: :unprocessable_entity
app/controllers/orders_controller.rb:          render json: { error: ""Error when processing subscription: #{params[:subscription_name]}"" },

app/controllers/zuora_callbacks_controller.rb:      render json: { error: result[:error] }, status: :internal_server_error

### Summary

A customer report that when making a purchase on [customers portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in), the payment was blocked because the bank thought the payment was suspicious which cause the payment page on customer portal to stuck as if it's still processing the payment.

### Steps to reproduce

(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)

1. Make a purchase on [customers portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in)
1. Get the transaction to be blocked by the bank
1. See the payment form stuck in the processing state

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The payment form stuck in processing state without providing any useful information

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

If there's an error, we should provide an error message and reason why the error happened.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)

`payment_method:17 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '&'`

The code is as follows:
```
<script>
window.parent.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('zuora-errors', {

76937907,2021-01-08 17:07:21.642,Combine FindCurrentSubscriptionVersionService logic into Subscription.current_subscription class method,"# Purpose

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2460, we've introduced a way to find the current version of a subscription record via the `FindCurrentSubscriptionVersionService`.  In the past we also introduced a class method on the `Subscription` model called `current_subscription` which finds the current rate plans and rate plan charges for a given subscription (but didn't find the current subscription version).  It was our intention when that class method was introduced to go back when we were able to find the current subscription version and incorporate that logic.

The following discussion from !2460 should be addressed:

When we did that, we could use that here if we wanted (but not sure if it makes sense).  This sounds like a good candidate for a follow-up issue.

### Summary

An existing GitLab customer cannot reset their password in the GitLab customer portal from within their account.  It shows successfully completed but still uses the old password.  This has been repeated by the customer in different browsers without ad blockers running and in private modes so no cached data might interfere somewhere.  I gave it a severity 4 since it's a single customer and they can still use their account they just can't change the password at the moment.

### Steps to reproduce

The customer enters the old and new passwords and the system shows completed but no change is made.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The password never changes.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The password should update.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots
There are no records of any error newer than a year ago for this customer in Sentry.

### Workarounds

None known.

For each section below, please add screenshots or links or anything that may help visual learners understand the problem better, even if this takes you an extra minute or two this is a great help to some folks.

https://www.learning-styles-online.com/style/visual-spatial/

-->

### Problem

The IronBank gem, which the CustomersDot app uses, automatically converts field names like `perform_reconciliations__c` to `PerformReconciliations__c` before calling the Zuora API. Due to this, trying to update the `perform_reconciliations__c` field from the CustomersDot app fails.

### Proposal

1. Create a new custom field in production Zuora with the same details as https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomField.do?method=viewDetail&id=2c92c0f87688a09601768ac3019f7cc5&objectType=Subscription. Note that the field label is  `Perform reconciliations1?` on sandbox just to visually distinguish it from the existing custom field during testing. On production Zuora, the label can be `Perform reconciliations?`.

1. Update the CustomersDot app to use the new custom field and remove the old (`perform_reconciliations__c`) one.

1. Delete the existing `perform_reconciliations__c` field once the production CustomersDot app has been updated.

#### Steps

- [X] Add new custom field to Zuora sandbox.
- [X] Add new custom field to sandbox schema files - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2443.
- [x] Remove old custom field from sandbox schema files - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2502.
- [x] Remove the old custom field from Zuora sandbox.
- [x] Observe staging to see if there are any problems.
- [x] Remove old custom field from production schema files - !2613.
- [x] Ask `@mquitevis` to rename the custom field in production Zuora.
- [x] Add the new custom field to production schema files: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2688

### Result

The CustomersDot app is able to update the value of the `PerformReconciliations__c` field.

In subscription renew pages, we're changing the price `per user yearly` according to the selected plan.

However, when the plan changed and before the request is complete, we show a loading spinner on all soon-to-change parts (e.g. invoice, total, etc.).

But we are missing the loading spinner on the price per user part.

However, this method using the following logic, which queries for all subscriptions in Zuora, then subsequently all rate plans and rate plan charges, and initializes `Subscription` objects for each one.  This is very inefficient, especially for customers with more than one subscription.

```
  def current_customer_has_subscription?
    return unless current_customer

    SubscriptionsFinder.for_customer(current_customer).present?
  end
```

This seems like an easy win to speed up almost all our page loads because this helper is called in the navigation partial which is used in the application layout (IOW most pages).

### Proposal

Instead of using `SubscriptionsFinder`, here are a few alternatives:

- A simple fix would be to pull `raw_subscriptions` directly from the customer and return if any are found.  This bypasses the queries for rate plans rate plan charges.  This could be something like: `current_customer.raw_subscriptions.any?`.
- Even better would be to limit the query to Zuora to only pull the first subscription.  Something like `current_customer.raw_subscriptions(limit: 1).any?`.  This would require a few modifications but IronBank supports limits in `where` (e.g. `Zuora::Subscription.where({status: 'Active', account_id: cus.zuora_account_id}, limit: 1)`.

### Result

Faster page loads.",2

Gold subscription does not charge for any guest users in the targetted namespace. But when buying a new Gold subscription for an existing group that already has guests in it, this exception is not taken into consideration.

### Steps to reproduce

The steps below include screenshots taken on https://customers.stg.gitlab.com and https://staging.gitlab.com

1. In GitLab, create a group with one guest in it - which bring the total of members to 2:

75976988,2020-12-11 22:04:15.487,New customer purchase workflow prevents purchases on groups with expired subscriptions,"### Summary

The new customer purchase workflow that occurs on the GitLab.com side (rather than customers.gitlab) prevents users from selecting a group to apply a new purchase on if that desired group currently has an expired subscription which is still within the 14-day grace period. For example, purchasing a new Bronze plan to replace the expired Gold plan is not possible.

### Steps to reproduce

Have a group with an expired subscription, but which is still within the grace period before the system automatically downgrades the group to Free.  Attempt a new purchase workflow from customerDot, which redirects to gitlab.com/susbcriptions. The dropdown when choosing a group for the new subscription is not populated with desired group

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Customer should be able to make a new purchase for a group with an expired subscription

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

1. Customer has 3 groups, one of which is currently on Gold with expired subscription:

![groups-in-cd-admin](/uploads/cb742a718edfc6e1216826c2b7e94320/groups-in-cd-admin.png)

2. From customers.gitlab.com, when attempting to purchase a new plan, the workflow redirects to `gitlab.com/subscriptions` and the form only displays 2 groups, neither are the desired group:

![new-workflow](/uploads/798787d697b430b8086118fc967410ae/new-workflow.png)

3. There are no available plans for purchase when viewing group billing page:

![dotcom-billing](/uploads/5a7678f87301c39ed50be570b998bff2/dotcom-billing.png)


**However**, Circumventing the new process (see below) shows the group with the expired subscription as available for applying a new purchase:

![cd-workflow](/uploads/e7cec93ab357447fef6f0a5a28e7452f/cd-workflow.png)

### Workarounds

Circumventing the redirect to gitlab.com and going directly to the customerDot URL and entering the `plan_id` allows the purchase to continue from customers.gitlab.com, and the group is available.  For example, bronze plan id `2c92a0ff5a840412015aa3cde86f2ba6`:

`https://customers.gitlab.com/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92a0ff5a840412015aa3cde86f2ba6&transaction=create_subscription`

Purchase workflow can then continue directly from customerDot.

Alternatively, manually downgrading the group to free should also allow the new purchase to proceed.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2141 we created a `Subscription` designation for internal admins viewing customers.gitlab.com admin search results to allow them to easily distinguish which of the customer records are associated with a Zuora subscription.

The criteria for the work was solely the presence of a `Zuora account` id associated with the customer record. While this covers the majority of cases, there will be edge cases where an id is present but no valid subscription exists. We made the trade off to implement with this known constraint as it was a fast and low cost implementation.

### Summary


A storage purchase for the client didn't unblock the project. The purchase was successful and the `Usage Quotas` page was showing  Purchased storage available as 28.3 out of 30 Gib. Despite that, the customer's project was blocked in read-only mode. 

The project in question is nested under another namespace. Not sure if that is related though. 


### Steps to reproduce

Issue is reproducible for locked projects in a sub-group:

* Create sub-group
* Create a project in the sub group with at least one file (e.g. 2mb file)
* Set a low repo size limit (e.g. 1mb) so that the storage limit is reached by that repo (via Admin > Settings > General > Account and limit > Size limit per repository)
* Purchase a storage pack to unlock the namespace
* Attempt to create a new branch in the project - error shown as below

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The project wasn't unblocked.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Once the storage purchase is completed all the project over 10Gb should be unlocked if there is anough additional storage.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

Kibana logs about rejecting push: https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/f086203335b19efeed4424ea34a39682. There you can see the POST attempting to create the branch `test_test` and then a reply back when querying `/api/:version/internal/allowed` with a status code of 401

The error message in UI was:

### Problem

We're currently using generic error messages to let the user know something went wrong.

These error message strings are scattered throughout the codebase, and not consistent between each other.

```
❯ git grep ""A unexpected error occurred""
app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/add_seats_form.vue:          this.$emit('error', 'A unexpected error occurred');
app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/change_namespace_form.vue:          this.$emit('error', 'A unexpected error occurred');

spec/frontend/subscription/components/add_seats_form_spec.js:      expect(wrapper.emitted().error).toStrictEqual([[''], [''], ['A unexpected error occurred']]);

### Problem

We've recently introduced SaaS manual renew. However a user can have subscriptions with only addon products (CI minutes and Storage), and those subscriptions can not be renewed. Leading to an empty page if the user tries to push the renew button.

Note that this currently sits behind the feature flag `saas_manual_renew `

### Proposal

Do not render a Renew button for addon-only subscriptions.

I _think_ we can use a check like `subscription.belongs_to_gitlab_com_without_add_ons_plan?` as per this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/123eb8b641b25657798feaf2391e72af16cfbcbd/app/presenters/subscription_presenter.rb#L97

74927804,2020-11-24 17:50:03.895,Some products in Zuora production are missing from Sandbox,"# Background

Zuora sandbox has been maintained separately from Zuora production for a while.  The product catalog in Zuora sandbox does not reflect that of Zuora production, both in the amount of products offered and the structure of the products, rate plans, and rate plan charges.

For example, many of the support plans (sold via sales-assisted deals) are not part of sandbox, and therefore are not listed in [the `config/application.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a7e53acf6a9c04c20be85de28175433e36d6a690/config%2Fapplication.yml).  Any plans like this are not covered in automated tests and not able to be tested manually.

Also, the structure of the product catalog is different which can lead to confusion.  For example, the Silver Plan is [listed here in Sandbox](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/Product.do?method=view&id=2c92c0f85aac66b3015aaea7163344f7) as a top-level product.  However, it is nested inside of [the Product ""GitLab.com"" in production](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Product.do?method=view&id=2c92a0fe5a83f009015aa3ccb71426ff).

# Purpose

The purpose of this issue is to clean-up these inconsistencies and allow us to test all types of products that are supported in Production.  This will require a lot of coordination with engineers to pull off successfully as Sandbox is used by engineers for local development/testing, CI, and Staging.

Note: There is a related task, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/655, to create a production-copy for sandbox.

Great! You don't need to do anything here.

### Problem

We have 67 (at the time of writing) hosted pages in our [Zuora sandbox](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/HostedPageLite.do) which makes it difficult to get an overview of which pages are in use and not.

74863624,2020-11-23 19:31:19.685,OSS - allow subscribers to purchase discounted support,"## Summary

When a community member is approved for one of GitLab's free Gold/Ultimate programs (OSS/EDU/Startups), we create a $0.00 subscription utilizing a specific program-based sku for the 12 month term applicable for the subscription.

We want to allow community members participating in these programs the ability to purchase support at a discounted rate.

## Proposal

Conditionally display `purchase support` button on the subscription card based on the sku associated with the active subscription.

For example, for active subscription utilizing the EDU/OSS $0.00 Gold/ULtimate skus, display a new button which would kick off a paid purchase flow for paid (discounted) support service.

Designs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2345/

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] The discount should be coded as part of the sku and not required to be calculated by CustomersDot
1. [ ] The user should be able to check out in customers.gitlab.com using a credit card
1. [ ] The paid support add-on should coterm with the existing EDU/OSS subscription
1. [ ] The purchase support information should be sent to SFDC so the support level can be updated in SFDC",5

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] The add seats button should be added to the `Manage purchases` page
1. [ ] The add-on amendment should net $0.00 (noting associated skus are already set to $0.00 in Zuora)
1. [ ] ~~For EDU, we should not allow more than `x` total subscribed users~~
1. [ ] ~~For OSS, we should not allow more than `y` total subscribed users~~

There aren't any reproduction steps for this error as it's not clear _what_ causes this, and this doesn't happen all the time (which sort of suggests a race condition or failed HTTP call).

### TODO

- [ ] Investigate if we're misusing the 3rd party code (iframe hasn't been mounted to the DOM before we make the iframe params fetch)
- [ ] Make the UI resilient against this error (a failure should show an alert to the user, not just stay on the loading spinner)",3

74167126,2020-11-10 20:17:04.328,Community Programs Self-Checkout,"## Summary

The Communities teams (OSS, Start-Ups, EDU) will be working with a vendor to create an automated application process - webform to interact with the applicant which screens through the qualification process. Once the applicant is approved, they will receive a coupon code and be prompted to self-checkout on customers.gitlab.com to complete the subscriptions creation and provisioning processes.

### Process overview
1. Upon approval, the applicants receive a coupon code
1. The applicant navigates to customers.gitlab.com, selects new subscription flow
1. User enters the code at checkout and the subscription is booked at $0.00
     1. The subscription must be created using the applicable Community Programs sku
     1. The user should not be prompted to enter a credit card since the net is $0.00
1. Normal provision process follows

### Coupon Code Generator Features
1. We need to store the generated codes so they can be referenced during checkout
1. The coupon code should relate to product sku (info received from the vendor call) which when applied to a purchase flow, would dictate which product sku we are selling
1. The code can not be reused; once redeemed, we invalidate the code in our DB for future use
1. The code will provide a specific discount per sku
1. The vendor presenting the coupon code after successful application cannot utilize an API to receive the coupon from us. We will need to provide the vendor with bulk codes via a file upload periodically.

## Tasks

1. [ ] Introduce the Coupon Code on the FE (New subscription flow)
     1. There is a coupon code field which was hidden via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/662; let's just reveal that field again.
1. [ ] Build the coupon code generator
1. [ ] Build BE logic to recognize coupon code
1. [ ] Determine how to handle Renewal Process
1. [ ] Determine how to handle Add-On users midterm",5

### Problem

We don't validate subscription on purchasing an add-on for it. Grab the correct URL for purchasing an add-on: `http://localhost:5000/subscriptions/new?plan_id=2c92c0f9699eca030169a2f1f117045f&subscription_id=A-S00048152&transaction=ci_minutes` and change the query key `subscription_id` to anything else, for example `subscriptio_id`.
Now open it in your browser. I expect a redirect to the subscription list page but instead I see the purchase screen which does not work.

We should validate the subscription and redirect the customer to the `/subscriptions` path if invalid subscription was provided.

73198626,2020-10-22 19:16:56.844,"New Order from .com billing page results in {""last_name"":[""can't be blank""]}","### Summary

[Customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/176452) (internal link) attempted to purchase a new Bronze SaaS subscription _from within GitLab.com_ group billing page. Upon attempting to complete the order, they received the error:

> {""last_name"":[""can't be blank""]}

This prevents the purchase, and resulted in a support ticket. The workaround was for customer to create a customerDot account, and proceed with purchase in the traditional manner.

I'm opening this bug on the gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com project for now because it's not fully clear to me yet where exactly the bug is at, though I suspect it's on the .com side. We can move it as needed.

My suspicion that this is a .com bug is based on a few factors:

1. [Quite some time ago](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13661), gitlab.com began [experimentally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/growth/engineering/-/issues/64) requiring a ""Last Name"" field for new user registration
   1. A [separate MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/42346) recently began to ""split"" legacy names into a first and last name field. If I understand the design in that MR, it *can* cause an empty string for a last name
1. [Kibana log](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/7e98fff77a38dda1a9a7ed869137d7d2) of the customer hitting `SubscriptionsController#create` via `/-/subscriptions/new` on GitLab.com.  There is no associated Sentry errors for customer.gitlab.com that I can locate
1. Prior to the support ticket being created, customer never had a customersDot account, so it's not possible that they would have attempted a purchase from customer portal. However, I'm unfamiliar with the behind-the-scenes code, so it's possible group billing page is calling out to customerDot to process the transaction. To the best of my knowledge, purchases from customersDot do require a `last_name` field.

### Steps to reproduce

Presumably using any GitLab.com user without a `last_name` (or a blank one), from any group not currently on a paid tier, navigate to Settings > Billing page, click ""Upgrade"" under any of the 3 paid tiers. Note, ""Upgrade"" is displayed regardless if it's a new subscription or an actual upgrade from a lower tier.

Proceed normally by filling in details.

Purchase fails.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

New purchase workflow from GitLab.com UI results in inability to purchase.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

A successful transaction

### Workarounds

* Use customersDot.
* *Possibly* edit GitLab.com user profile `name` field to be two ""words"", causing the name to split into a first and last name. This was not confirmed
  * It is currently [not possible](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CDLCBGEDV/p1603382908188600?thread_ts=1603381169.185600&cid=CDLCBGEDV) to edit one's profile and manually enter a Last Name, nor is it possible for an admin to enter one.

72855342,2020-10-16 21:00:39.228,Investigate Quarterly Co-terms from License Sync data,"### Problem

With the Cloud License Sync epic, we will be gathering license information from self-managed instances, similar to how we gather Seat Link data.  Both will be gathered on a routine basis (daily) and contain information on max historical user count and license key.  Given that there is this duplication, we should be able to retire Seat Link eventually in favor of License Sync.

We don't have all the specifics worked out yet but we feel confident that we can get quarterly co-terms working with license sync. Basically the idea would be to use the data from the license sync requests to feed the Reconciliation model, instead of using the seat link requests. It's a pretty simple concept from that standpoint, but there are still some details to be worked out such as:

* Ensure the license sync data contains the data points that are required by Reconciliation (e.g. report date, license start date, license end date, max historical user count)
* For seat link requests, the request received on day X contains data from day X-1. For license sync requests, I'm not sure it necessarily has to be that way, but there are good ways to keep with that same method. A day offset gives the rake task the opportunity to capture the user count information from HistoricalData after it has a chance to retry if necessary.
* Figure out the handoff for which data input feeds the reconciliations (seat link vs license sync). Maybe both would be fine as it should be the same data, but that needs some thought.
* Seat Link has been on for a while (introduced in an earlier version of GL) and by default SM instances opted in.  For License Sync, this has to be activated so we might not be gather as much data through this method, at least to begin with.  Determine if the business is okay with this. The handoff discussed int the above bullet point might inform this decision too.

72733380,2020-10-14 20:05:10.825,Identify idempotency issues on gitlab.com provisioning job retries,"In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1440 we found a few cases where we retry jobs when an error occurs in the gitlab.com provisioning process. 

* https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/namespace/update_plan_info_service.rb#L30

Nothing jumped out at me that I think would cause an issue on retries but I'm also not sure that the retries actually help anything. It's possible we are just polluting the retry queue with jobs that failed and will never succeed. We should verify:

1. We are not causing idempotency issues when we retry.
2. Retries have the potential to succeed instead of just continuing to error.

72716593,2020-10-14 14:01:54.079,Add test coverage for renewals at list price,"# Background

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2057, we added the ability to use the list price instead of the original discounted price when performing renewals.  However, as mentioned in the discussion below, it was difficult to add test coverage for this case because it required creating some test objects in Zuora (products, rate plan charges, etc) rather than mocking. This is because the [`amend_subscription_service_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/755f660e602579136967dd818dc9049e782c2eaa/spec/services/amend_subscription_service_spec.rb) and [`renew_subscriptions_pajamas_spec.rb`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a8eea433e2c8d5a2ae9cc8f4c94711ee22d62f7c/spec/features/renew_subscriptions_pajamas_spec.rb) use VCR.

# Proposal

Ensure proper test coverage for renewals in scenarios that should use list price and discounted price.

## Follow-up from Discussion

I was thinking it might be good to have a scenario where the `main_product.renewal_price` actually uses the latest product catalog price (e.g. where [this line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/49bb3d9b1311700c7d8ffdcdc5085e28c5424af3/app/models/product.rb#L38) is true).

As mentioned in [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4225), we no longer require the manual EULA process. As part of this work, we should not need to resend EULA request email from the Admin panel.

This was first attempted as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1836, but we realized that we needed to keep this functionality around a bit longer as we sunset customers on the legacy EULA process.  We should tackle this in a future milestone similar to when we start work on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1841.  In that issue, we determined we should start the work 90 days after the existing Eula process was turned off (2020-10-13).  Exact date TBD.

### Problem

Orders within Subscription App are meant to be a 1:1 mapping to Zuora Subscriptions and be in sync.

However some times the orders and the subscription that originated them diverge, whether because the subscription was cancelled/refunded and our app was lacking the logic to react to that scenario or because the callouts from Zuora never happened or all failed, Zuora is down, Subscription App is down... (so many possibilities)

So although we can create better mechanisms to account for each of this origins (and we are and should continue to do so), these are two independent systems and keep them in sync is not possible:100:% of the time.

That is why we want to put up for consideration to proactively fix these sync gaps when those are uncovered.

By:
- Identifying a set of Zuora errors we get consistently.
- Set up corrective reactions within the Subscription App.

### :warning: Sync no more, soon...

Our final goal is to make Zuora the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for CustomersDot and we want to keep that present and work towards that whenever possible. This translates into us writing any future code considering to actually rely on Zuora instead of reusing what is saved in `orders`. *Not only for this but all issues.*

[Transition to Zuora as the SSoT Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664) will group all the effort to accomplish this, it aims ""to reduce the data duplication in CustomerDot with Zuora and move us closer to calling Zuora the SSoT"". This is a big effort and in the meanwhile we want to still alleviate some of sales blockers if possible and that is what this issue is about.

### What we want to solve

**SITUATION:** Customer is purchasing a .com plan for a namespace that has a refunded subscription associated to this.

**WHAT HAPPENS TODAY:** Customer is unable to proceed, contacts support, support deals manually with the order's state, support creates a ticket, the ticket is prioritized and ultimately an engineer will pick it up and try to find out the cause for this out of sync state (this cause is at this point not relevant, maybe the order is for a moment in time we didnt have logic to reset the order, maybe Zuora's profile was in silence mode, maybe callouts failed...) This is a lot of effort.

**WHAT THIS ISSUE PROPOSES:**
When Subscriptions App gets an error that **looks like the one for that **might** be related to this case, instead of raising right away and triggering all the response above, we can take a step to the side and:
- Attempt to fix! In this case: Query Zuora for the state of the subscription associated to the order
- **IF** it is cancelled
  - Reset the order's subscription data via `ProcessInactiveSubscriptionService`
  - Reattempt the user action (best case scenario customer purchased and it is happy)
- **ELSE** fail like we do today


### Result

By ""closely"" reacting to the identified (known) errors such as the one outlined and correcting the data we are saving a lot of time to support and removing many future duplicated issues that are created as a result.",2

72097364,2020-10-02 20:15:39.872,Improve copy on email confirmation step,"## Problem

Webstore registration requires email confirmation, but the screen asking the user to confirm their email emphasizes resending the confirmation email, not the the main action of checking your email to click the confirmation link. 

It also doesn't tell user why confirmation is required (because we send the license to that email and we need to make sure it's right).

![browser_screen__9__1](/uploads/dd7ed617f0e91e9fc6fcb6850805d519/browser_screen__9__1.png)

## Proposal

- Move the info that's currently hidden in the alert down into the main body. 
- Add a value prop for the user to tell them why confirming their email is important (something like ""We need you to confirm your email so that we send your license to the right place."") 
- Give less emphasis to ""Resend confirmation instructions"" and more emphasis to the action that they really need to take which is ""Check your email.""

We need to allow the user to create a new group while they're in ""New GitLab Subscription"" and assign the new subscription to that group.

A follow-up to #1970.

### Proposal

Use the following design for the new GitLab.com subscription page

71705280,2020-09-25 18:50:41.143,SaaS upgrade flow should charge for users over license,"## Summary

When a SaaS customer with user overages upgrades their tier, we don't charge seats over their current subscribed amount. This causes issues at renewal for sales.


## Proposal

When the customer enters the Upgrade purchase flow, we should dynamically update the `seats` field with the greater of the `Seats currently in use` or `Seats in subscription`. Today the value defaults to the prior `subscription` Seats in subscription` quantity.

### Availability & Testing

<!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.

What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

Please list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.
* Unit test changes
* Integration test changes
* End-to-end test change

See the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning -->

> dynamically update the `seats` field with the greater of the `Seats currently in use` or `Seats in subscription`

This will require tests to ensure that one value takes precedence over the other, as well as a front-end test that ensures that the value is rendered in the field as expected.",2

`def enabled?(feature, context = {}, *args)`

There are so many place within the code where we already pass the empty hash.  Updating it would make it more convenient to use and clean up existing references.

71641477,2020-09-24 16:23:16.912,SPIKE: Migrate Autorenewal process to automated process flow in customers.gitlab.com,"## Summary

When a self-managed or GitLab.com subscription is set to autorenew, the process is driven by Zuora. Currently, this Zuora process requires manual intervention. While there is a possibility of automating this in Zuora, we may find that the timing and LOE is so large that we will not see manual process relief for some time.

### Manual effort estimation

Currently the billing team is spending an average of 110 hours monthly processing autorenewals (just those which actually renew, not those which must be cancelled due to non-payment) with a volume of over 560 subscriptions per month.

## Proposal

Let's explore what the dev effort would be to automatically process the renewal via customers.gitlab.com similar to what we will do with [Quarterly Coterms](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/27470) so that customers.gitlab.com processes the renewal and charging of credit card.

### Considerations

1. Where the original subscription was sourced by Web Store, we should only process and offer the autorenew feature for subscriptions with a valid credit card on file.
1. Where the original subscription was sourced by a sales-assisted order form, we should allow autorenew in any case. For those which have no credit card on file, we should generate the subscription and send an invoice.
1. Where the original subscription was sourced by a sales-assisted order form, we should identify if there is an open renewal opportunity in SFDC and if so, do not process autorenewal. (this can be follow-up iteration)",1

### Problem

@astoicescu recently updated their GDK, and due to security concerns the GDK now drops HTTPS calls if the certificate is invalid.

This is obviously a good thing.

This can cause issues for our local development though.

We recommend ngrok for local development, and their wildcard is `*.eu.ngrok.io `.

However if one creates a ngrok url with `.` like https://ragnar.zuora-payment.eu.ngrok.io/ it'll be two subdomains and the license will be invalid.

A workaround is to drop from `https` to `http`.

Users purchasing GitLab.com subscriptions are not prompted to enter a number of seats they would like to purchase during the new subscription purchase flow.

- The user should be able to manually enter the number of seats desired for purchase
- The system should provide a message if the user enters a number less than `Seats currently in use`
- If the number entered is less than `Seats currently in use` do not block the purchase

71095714,2020-09-14 07:48:31.445,BE: Check for `Seats currently in use` when seats are added for GL.com,"We are implementing [GitLab.com users should be able to purchase additional users without adding members](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1098), which allows users to add seats to their subscription as they go. The functionality is limited to updating the subscription and we do not check their current usage.

For this iteration, we should check the `Seats currently in use` count on gitlab.com. 

With this check, we are trying to encourage the customer to pay for their current usage, instead of just adding the seats they think they need. The customer is not obliged or guided to settle their usage during their subscription period, so this check is an opportunity to settle their true usage of seats. 

Because there is no automatic trueup charge on gitlab.com today (December 2020), we forfeit any seat usage money above their paid seats if the customer does not take any action to add and pay for seats. By checking for their current usage, there is a better chance that those seats will be accounted for.

**Happy path:**
1. Given the user has a subscription 
1. And the subscription is linked to the group namespace
1. When the user selects the `Add more seats` button on their subscription card
1. Then a check for the `Seats currently in use` count on gitlab.com will be triggered
1. The user should be prompted to purchase a minimum number of seats to cover their current use

#### Example

1. Current subscription seat quantity = `10`
1. Current seats in use = `15`
1. When user selects `Add more seats`, the default the minimum `Add additional seats` quantity should be `5`
1. The user should not be able to enter less than `5` additional seats and be able to checkout

----

Considerations for the check failing:
- the group and subscription are no longer linked because the group has been deleted
- the group and subscription are no longer linked because the gitlab.com user no longer has Owner access to the group

- [ ] @dbodicherla started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1941#note_410733506):  (+3 comments)

    > **question:** We seem to be doing a very similar thing within the `createOrUpdateSubscription` method. Do we plan to update that method eventually or are these two different code flows?

    > So after some digging, I found out that changing namespace and addon transactions use the `createOrUpdateSubscription` method which hits the same endpoint as `newSubscription` and I believe the payloads look same as well.

### Update

After a chat with @rhardarson, he told me that we should be used `purchaseSubscription` instead of `newSubscription`.

Using `newSubscription` does not wait for the new credit card to be stored and processed before continue the request to purchase the subscription.

Another interesting thing he mentioned:

> When purchasing a subscription for an account without any previous purchases (e.g. CI minutes) we'll be hitting the endpoint using `PUT` while we'll use `POST` for purchasing a subscription without any previous purchases.",2

70946762,2020-09-09 18:57:01.807,Spike: Investigate using OriginalId for Zuora Subscriptions,"### Problem

In Zuora, Subscriptions ID change throughout the life of the subscription as amendments are made.  We used to track subscriptions in the Customer Portal primarily using subscription IDs but changed to preferring the subscription name as the ID would change.  We've discovered an attribute called `OriginalId` which is advertised an immutable id for the life of the subscription.  This idea was raised as part of [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1926#note_410082430).

More information in the [Zuora Docs](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Subscriptions/A_Subscription_Introduction).

### Proposal

We should look into using this `OriginalId` to track subscriptions in the Portal instead of using subscription name or id.  If this is indeed a fixed ID, it would simplify logic in our system that does lookup by name or id.

If it looks like it will work as we expect, create an epic or issues to outline a transition plan to using the new `OriginalId` attribute",2

As https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1379 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1380 have closed, we need to test the integration prior to shipping to production.

[These action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/911#note_406203237) are the next steps to test in order to gain approval for deploying to production:

* [ ] Clone [customers.gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com)
* [ ] Work with @vshumilo and @cwiesner to get Ruby and the IRB working with customers, please tell us if there is existing documentation
* [ ] Point your local environment at our Sandbox, using your creds (so we can tell our tests apart from others)
* [ ] Put together a test script of the IRB commands you are firing and then checking the results in Salesforce sandbox.
* [ ] **Stretch Goal:** Be able to do a complete purchase via the Portal App running locally and verify results.

As part of the .com downgrade effort, we have a banner that is intended to display if the customer is past their subscription end date AND on a free plan. 

During testing we realized that the downgrade code initiated through Zuora as well as the Customers Portal reset the subscription start date to the date of the downgrade and clears out the end date. 


We would like to understand why this is the case and if there would be any unforeseen consequences if we were to change it. 

Please discuss.

# Bug

When upgrading Starter to Premium as part of Renewal, and the number of seats is greater than 25, the subscription card is no longer in view and the message `Could not get the data properly. If the problem persists, contact support.` is displayed:

https://www.loom.com/share/ff16c192dd4343a5a51d3cf7c52fe5d6

When I tried locally, I got the following error message. I could have a few FF disabled, so I'm not sure if this is the expected behavior.

![Screen_Shot_2022-12-14_at_6.40.09_PM](/uploads/5a575efcebc1f765f611dad96788e2f4/Screen_Shot_2022-12-14_at_6.40.09_PM.png)

25 is the max. seat limit, not sure if the expected behavior shows a better error message with the subscription card. Since the FF `use_orders_api_to_preview_amendment ` is globally enabled, I did not disable on staging and test it out the behavior on staging.

## Summary

(Summarize the bug encountered concisely)

Compare with Amend API workflow, and ensure both behave the same in EoA upgrade subscription preview.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Purchase Starter self managed subscription with end date in the last 3 days ([example request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/snippets/2469063) to create subscription via API)   
3. Access the subscription card in CDot   
4. Select 'Renew', select 'Premium' plan and set quantity to `26`. Observe the error

120439578,2022-12-14 23:33:03.081,Subscriptions with multiple rate plans should not auto-renew (temporary),"### Problem

Subscriptions that have multiple rate plans (for the same renewable plan) are auto-renewing incorrectly. See [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/issues/5399#note_1209871296) for additional context. 

### Proposal

Do not auto-renew subscriptions with multiple rate plans. We are [already doing it for EOA subscriptions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5226), but this should be extended to all subscription.

### Result

Subscriptions with multiple rate plans do not auto-renew.

### Next steps (if any)

Fix the auto-renewal functionality to account for multiple rate plans.

### Problem

`rails_admin` gem is blocking our upgrade to Rails 7:

```shell
Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem ""rails"":
  In Gemfile:
    rails (~> 7.0.4)

    rails_admin (~> 2.2.0) was resolved to 2.2.1, which depends on
      rails (< 7, >= 5.0)
```

In order to upgrade CustomersDot to Rails 7 we have to upgrade `rails_admin` gem to version 3. We use version `2.2.0` but version `3.1.0` is available and supports Rails 7 - https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/blob/master/rails_admin.gemspec#L13

Unfortunately there is not straightforwad upgrade path for this gem as new version has [many breaking changes](https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300beta---2021-12-20). Attempting to perform an upgrade in a dumb way:

```shell
### Upgrading RailsAdmin from 2.x.x to 3.x.x ###

    Due to introduction of Webpack/Webpacker support, some additional dependencies and configuration will be needed.
    Running `bin/rails g rails_admin:install` will suggest required changes, based on the current setup of your app.
```

Results in a missing method `assets`:

```shell
/Users/vslobodin/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.7/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/railties-6.1.7/lib/rails/railtie/configuration.rb:97:in `method_missing': undefined method `assets' for #<Rails::Application::Configuration:0x0000000128e96ca8>
Did you mean?  asset_host (NoMethodError)
```

Which indicates we have to load `sprockets`. Applying a small patch for that:

```diff
diff --git a/config/application.rb b/config/application.rb
index cb0b3a821..1a4fc7e26 100644
--- a/config/application.rb
+++ b/config/application.rb

 require 'prometheus/client'
+require 'sprockets/railtie'
 
 # Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
 # you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
```

Results in a missing `sassc`:

```shell
cannot load such file -- sassc
```

Adding it (`gem 'sassc-rails'`) makes the application starting at least but attempting to visit any admin page result in:

```
Showing /Users/vslobodin/.asdf/installs/ruby/2.7.7/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/rails_admin-3.1.0/app/views/rails_admin/main/_dashboard_history.html.erb where line #22 raised:

uninitialized constant RailsAdmin::Adapters::ActiveRecord::AbstractObject
Did you mean?  RailsAdmin::AbstractModel
```

This happens because `AbstractObject` was deprecated in favour of plain ActiveRecord https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin/commit/af88091d11590dc95df4866c62fba0c49a7bb9a8

To sum up, to achieve this upgrade we need to:

- apply all patches above or find another way to workaround mentioned issues.
- validate we load all JS and CSS correctly
- validate the whole RailsAdmin works with new version
- check and fix our tests in `spec/feature/rails_admin`

120359277,2022-12-13 19:02:09.120,Hide tooltip and term duration for CI minutes purchase,"### Problem

On customers staging, when purchasing CI minutes, the date of purchase is displayed as 1 day. 

The tooltip information next to it displays, `Your storage subscription has the same term as your main subscription, and the price is prorated accordingly.`

Additional CI minute purchases are added onto your existing subscription (if available), the duration of the term is for the existing subscription. But CI minutes are valid for 1 year after the purchase date, so the start date of the subscription is irrelevant and confusing making the term duration incorrect.

_PS - The error might also be occurring on the Production server._

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [-] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [-] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [-] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [-] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [-] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [-] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [-] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4884) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",1

119967619,2022-12-06 20:40:30.103,Refactor Customer/Account form,"## Proposal

Once the `account_data_structure` flag is enabled/stable and we start working towards https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8951+, the Account/Customer form in CustomersDot should be in a position to be refactored in a few ways.  Please see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6037#note_1196864310 for more background.

Here are a few things we can consider:
1. ~~Avoid showing or updating `Customer.company` in this form.  At this point, `BillingAccount.zuora_account_name` should be the attribute used across the app.  There should be no need to maintain `company`~~. EDIT: follow-up in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5656
2. `UpdateContactService` is called only from a Customer model callback. It's only triggered when the virtual attr `sync_with_zuora` is set, which only happens [in the RegistrationsController](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/37933553209ad5c0b13c33ab2a786200c2aa4d27/app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb#L36). It would be nice to avoid this callback altogether and move this logic to the `RegistrationsController`. This service could be refactored (and renamed) to clarify it's scope. 

### Follow up

The following discussion from !6037 should be addressed:

119760980,2022-12-02 15:30:28.580,Drop PSQL 10.17 from supported tools,"We migrated all our environments to CloudSQL on GCP. Both production and staging environments are on PSQL 12 now.
That means we can safely drop PSQL 10 from the list of supported runtimes and tools. Currently we have it in the `.tool-versions` file and in order to remove it from this file we should create or document convenient way for upgrading existing databases of team members (located in `./db/postgesql`).

## How to upgrade local PSQL database from 10 to 12

Given the database is running in `./db/postgresql` we can perform the following steps to upgrade it:

1. Stop the application
2. Stop the PSQL master:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_ctl stop -D ./db/postgresql
   ```

3. Demote the data folder to old cluster:

   ```shell
   mv ./db/postgresql ./db/postgresql-10
   ```

3. Activate PostgreSQL 12 binaries:

   ```shell
   asdf shell postgres 12.12
   ```

   Verify it with `psql --version`. This command must output `psql (PostgreSQL) 12.12`

4. Check the upgrade path:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_ctl initdb -D ./db/postgresql-12
   asdf exec pg_upgrade --old-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 10.17)/bin --new-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 12.12)/bin --old-datadir=./db/postgresql-10 --new-datadir=./db/postgresql-12 --check
   ```
   
   Look for the `*Clusters are compatible*` line at the end. If not, please report in this issue.

5. Do the upgrade:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_upgrade --old-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 10.17)/bin --new-bindir=$(asdf where postgres 12.12)/bin --old-datadir=./db/postgresql-10 --new-datadir=./db/postgresql-12
   ```

6. Start the new PSQL 12 master:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_ctl start -D ./db/postgresql-12
   ```

7. Generate minimal optimizer statistics to verify the new database: `./analyze_new_cluster.sh`
8. Run the script to delete the old database data: `./delete_old_cluster.sh`
9. Move the new database cluster to the old location `./db/postgresql`:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_ctl stop -D ./db/postgresql-12 && mv ./db/postgresql-12 ./db/postgresql
   ```

10. Remove migration files: `rm analyze_new_cluster.sh delete_old_cluster.sh update_extensions.sql`
11. Start the new database cluster and verify your local copy of CustomersDot still works:

   ```shell
   asdf exec pg_ctl start -D ./db/postgresql

119743087,2022-12-02 10:06:57.035,Add logging in CloudActivations::ActivateService when seat link creation failed,"### Problem

When an activation of a self-managed instance with an activation code failed because of an error while creating the seat link data, the error is [logged by the SeatLinkCreateService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L24-27). The `SeatLinkCreateService` is used in other workflows like the daily seat link sync. This makes debugging for errors during an activation a little bit harder since the `CloudActivations::ActivateService` [does not log anything](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L89) about this with its own context and the errors have to be looked up with a `SeatLinkCreateService` context. 

### Proposal

Even though the [`SeatLinkCreateService` has logging for an unsuccessful processing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L24-27), it might make sense to add additional logging in the 
`CloudActivations::ActivateService` when the [response of the `SeatLinkCreateService` is unsuccessful](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L89). This could make debugging errors during an activation a bit easier and quicker since we would be able to actually find error loggings for the `CloudActivations::ActivateService` even when the actual error happened in the `SeatLinkCreateService`.

### Result

Additional error logging that helps with debugging errors during activation quicker since we'll be able to find something specifically linked to the activation when the seat link creation failed.",2

# Bug

## Summary

Sometimes purchases fail with the generic error `An error occurred in the purchase step. If the problem persists please contact support at https://support.gitlab.com.` but when we check the logs we find an error log that states:

```
<PaymentMethodID> is not a valid hosted payment method.
```

119658060,2022-11-30 21:07:42.343,[SM] Use term end date for all ramp enabled subscription licenses,"### Background
Historically, all ramp licenses were generated for term start date + 1 year. With Zuora Ramps, we are establishing automated provisioning of licenses for the entire ramp subscription period, so this shortened term is no longer necessary.

With the Zuora workflow being setup by EntApps, callouts will be sent from Zuora to CDot whenever a new ramp interval starts in order to provision additional seats at the start at each ramp interval.

### Problem

As discussed in this thread https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4295#note_1189876785, ramped subscriptions where cloud licensing is enabled have licenses generated for the full subscription term.  For example, if a subscription has a 3 one year ramps, the full subscription term is 3 years, and therefore has a license generated for the full 3 years.  If the quantity changes when a new ramp begins, a callout will be sent to CDot to generate a new license with the new quantity for the full term.

The logic for determining the license end date can be [found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ec6b3cc9dca0e511568ba86c0b3d6db99cfdcd19/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L15).  Currently, this logic only applies to Subscriptions with cloud licensing enabled, but we need it for Subscriptions with legacy licenses too.

### Proposal

Update the `LicenseCreation#license_end_date` method to determine the license end date consistently for all ramp enabled subscriptions, using the term end date.


### Proposal Summary

Generate the initial license for a ramp subscription for the entire 3 year subscription term (and then send a new license for only the additional users at the start of each year).

Reason for this proposal, rather than generating the initial license for 1 year and sending a new license for the full user amount at the start of each year:
1. We are moving towards generating all licenses for the entire subscription term, not just ramps ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4816)), as it requires less manual intervention. Option 2 is consistent with this motion.
1. There is no risk of the customer losing access entirely if there is any provision failure at the start of years 2/3 - only not having access to the additional seats. Seems this could result in fewer support escalations.
1. This was the plan with cloud license enabled subscriptions, so to me it makes sense to keep both types consistent.

### Proposal Details
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4879 updated the existing license end date logic to generate ramp enabled licenses for the full subscription term for cloud enabled subscriptions _only_. We should remove this condition on cloud enabled by updating [this line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ec6b3cc9dca0e511568ba86c0b3d6db99cfdcd19/app/models/concerns/license_creation.rb#L15).

I think we want to update this:
> `# If Subscription is cloud and (reconciliations or ramps enabled), we issue it for the full term`

To this:
> `# If Subscription is (cloud and reconciliations) or ramps enabled, we issue it for the full term`

Side note, once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4816 is implemented, the logic will actually be:
> `# If Subscription is cloud or ramps enabled, we issue it for the full term`

### Result
All ramp licenses (whether cloud or not) are created for the full term.",1

### Background
We currently have 4 mailers that can be sent to customers when a Self Managed subscription is purchased - a legacy specific mailer, an offline license specific mailer, a cloud license specific mailer, and a unified mailer.

The unified mailer was initially established in the early days of Cloud Licensing and contained _both_ the legacy license and a cloud license activation code. This was sent to customers who had `TurnOnCloudLicensing` set to `null`. As part of SCL, we removed the legacy license from this mailer as we began to treat `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `null` customers the same as `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `Yes`. Therefore it is now a duplicate of the activation code mailer.

In addition, the check for `super_sonics_aware` is no longer necessary. Since we are over 1 year past the launch of Super Sonics (August 2021), all new or renewal subscriptions will now be super sonics aware. This can be removed as unnecessary logic.

Related part of code:
![image](/uploads/c8fad86be7698188a6258e238c1f69ca/image.png)

### Proposal
Deprecate the unified license mailer and simplify the existing mailer logic to send only the legacy, offline or activation code mailer as is appropriate based on the license type the customer will receive, with no dependency on `super_sonics_aware`.

Rough suggestion:
* If legacy, send legacy mailer
* If offline, send offline mailer
* Else, must be online, so send online mailer (reordered as I think online mailer should be the default)

In addition, we should deprecate the related [unified voucher email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/mailers/unified_license_voucher_mailer_spec.rb), as this will no longer be needed.

### Result
Simplification in our customer mailers.

What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

Please list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.

This refactor change will likely result in a lot of changed files and tests. On hand-hand, this should be a simple consolidation however on the other hand, we risk breaking something. 

We should be able to move all existing tests from our other mailers into one mailer as proposed, but it's possible more will have to be done to ensure everything works properly.  

From a ~Quality perspective, let's make sure these MRs are reviewed from the ~test perspective and that we don't suffer test coverage loss due to this change.",2
119634264,2022-11-30 14:55:00.495,[SM] Avoid license notification when provisioning is not needed when ramps begin,"### Problem

Once https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5247 is completed, all ramp subscriptions will have licenses generated for the full subscription term.  For example if a 3 year subscription might have 3 one year ramps.  Any licenses generated for this subscription would be created for the full 3 years.

However, as discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4295#note_1190124058, there may be times when nothing changes to the subscription when a new ramp starts that affects provisioning (e.g. the quantity does not change).  If that's the case, a callout will still be sent to CDot to provision for the new ramp.  An identical license would generated and notification sent to the customer, leading to confusion as a new license would not be necessary.

### Proposal

Let's update CDot to avoid generating a new license and avoid notifying the customer when this scenario arises.  

This filtering logic probably will need to be done when processing the callout. It might be similar to what CDot for [the Seat Link Service](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4ae39fa629f11d88d5575837412df990e624b9a5/app/services/seat_link_create_service.rb#L193).

119466630,2022-11-28 08:27:35.774,Simplify support of multiple class objects in VoucherMailer,"### Problem

As part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5929#note_1180208624, the logic to find the email, name and company of the recipient as well as the log info in the `VoucherMailer` was getting too complex. This is because there are now three classes (`License`, `Subscription` and `Customer`) that are supported by the `VoucherMailer`. In the linked thread there were a few options that were discussed. But [one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5929#note_1182039949) seemed like the way to go.

### Proposal

All three classes, `License`, `Subscription` and `Customer`, used in the `VoucherMailer` should respond to the same methods. E.g. currently only `License` and `Customer` respond to an `email` method and `Subscription` has to use the `sold_to_contact&.work_email` methods to get to the same info. If all three classes respond to the same method name, a single object could be provided to the VoucherMailer and removes all the current complexity by calling the method names that are supported by all three classes.

### Result

Remove complexity around the logic to find the email, name and company of the recipient as well as the log info in the `VoucherMailer`.",2

### Proposal

### Problem

The recently created CloudLicense mailers for [`renewal_notification`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3cbef4c4b31ea7553f33165166e5dcef3f09e7d6/app/mailers/cloud_license_mailer.rb#L19) (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4542) and [`subscription_update_notification`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3cbef4c4b31ea7553f33165166e5dcef3f09e7d6/app/mailers/cloud_license_mailer.rb#L12) (introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4543) do not implement a voucher mailer, so no notification to the SFDC BCC or the reseller email is sent.

Both mailers send a [BCC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3cbef4c4b31ea7553f33165166e5dcef3f09e7d6/app/mailers/cloud_license_mailer.rb#L10) to the revenue team email address (licenses@gitlab.com). 

Since we are trying to improve our Proof of License Delivery mechanisms for resellers, ensuring that Cloud Licensing renewals and subscription updates are available for them seems like a logic next step.

### Proposal

Introduce a new `CloudLicenseVoucherMailer` with two methods (one for renewals and another for subscription updates) and call those methods from the corresponding notification.

### Result

* The vouchers provide better visibility for the Sales and Order Management teams by storing them in SFDC
* The vouchers provide better visibility for resellers by sending them to the `Invoice Owner` of the partner

### Problem

**Context**:

When upgrading a subscription from `Premium` to `Ultimate` plan (for example), there are two invoice items generated:

1. Remove Premium plan
2. Add Ultimate plan

In Zuora staging environment, the order in which the invoice items generated are different for Amend and Orders API:

- When using Amend API: `Remove Premium plan`, `Add Ultimate plan`
- When using Orders API: `Add Ultimate plan`, `Remove Premium plan`

The order of Order actions is: `RemoveProduct`, `AddProduct` (see example [Order object](https://test.zuora.com/apps/newlogin.do?retURL=/orders#/view/O-00150386))

**Problem statement**:

When creating SalesForce objects, a [single Quote Rate Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4beb9cee77c7b495c0bd9e3f543599c919beaadf/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_objects_service.rb#L168) is created for an invoice (based on the first invoice item).

The order of the invoice items therefore becomes significant, as it causes [`zqu__ProductRatePlan__c`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a83ed49dff1dc0dddce7105d26af4244fbf0de72/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_rate_plan_service.rb#L80) and [`zqu__ProductRatePlanZuoraId__c`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a83ed49dff1dc0dddce7105d26af4244fbf0de72/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_rate_plan_service.rb#L81) attributes to be different in both cases.

In the case of Amend API, `zqu__ProductRatePlanZuoraId__c` is associated with Premium Plan, while in Orders API it is associated with Ultimate Plan.

This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ltJBcLwOau3-95CuHCwlXiZP200XkCqdeKtdpoYNUBI/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=113070913643997337994) documents the comparison.
In the case of sandbox environment, I observed the order of the invoice items to be the same (see [spreadsheet, tab 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mydR5iZd4709tLkKRal30vE3Xad1dsxGOzCwhiwB7HQ/edit)).

The scope of this issue is to understand:

- Should a single Quote Rate Plan OR multiple Quote Rate Plans (one for each invoice item) be created
- Based on the answer to the above question, if a single Quote Rate Plan needs to be created, should it be created for `RemoveProduct` or `AddProduct` or if it does not have a significance.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Summarizing the [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5193#note_1179678115), the following changes need to be applied when creating objects using Orders API:

1. Based on SalesForce package, for each order action type, 1 Quote Amendment, 1 Quote Rate Plan and 1 Quote Rate Plan Charge needs to be created. This approach will also resolve the inconsistent order detailed in this issue.

   In the existing Amend API workflow, 1 Quote Amendment is created for each amendment type. For every invoice, 1 Quote Rate Plan is created, and for every invoice item, 1 Quote Rate Plan Charge is created. No change to be made in this workflow.

1. Additionally, charge summary needs to be created for each amendment type. Given this is not currently created in Amend API, created https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5211 to follow-up on the requirement.

1. `Amendment.Id` and `Amendment.Name` is `nil` in the case of Orders API. @sbaranidharan to confirm if these attributes can be determined from any other object in Zuora.

   -> The Zuora team mentioned the values will be `nil` since we have orders harmonization enabled.

### Result

With the above approach, the problem stated in this issue is resolved as we create Quote Rate plan for every order action type and are no longer dependent on the order of order action types.

### Problem
As suggested in this [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4372#note_865226482), it would be a good idea to move the logic block in `subscriptions/community_program/renew_subscription.html.haml` into a helper. With this we would get the additional advantage of being tested. The same helper could be used for `subscriptions/community_program/renew_subscription`(https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/602a40bbc66d0c353787fea9f56b9f8b6efea4e3/app/views/subscriptions/community_program/renew_subscription.html.haml#L1) too as it has similar logic.

122355483,2022-11-15 16:39:06.272,Fulfillment Platform PI instrumentalization: Developer Productivity,"## Overview

We want to measure `MTTR` (mean time to recovery) as one of the ~""group::fulfillment platform"" performance indicators. This will help us to capture the state and progress of the developer productivity within the fulfillment infrastructure we provide.

## Details

The proposal and progress of the PI is captured in the [Fulfillment PI internal handbook section](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/fulfillment-section/#fulfillment-platform---mean-time-to-recovery-mttr).

**Definition of MTTR: Measure time (in minutes) between interruption of service(s) due to deployment/system failure and full recovery**

After a [first feedback loop](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/876#note_1165028722), and a sync discussion we identified a way how to instrument this metric:

We capture events whenever CustomersDot enters and leaves maintenance mode. This is visible when the `HealthCheck::Zuora` and `HealthCheck::Gitlab` jobs are triggered and when they catch changes of availability of these third-party services.

Additionally, triggering the maintenance mode manually (through the `customers:maintenance_mode` rake task) should also capture such events for the creation of this metric.


## Outcome

We can measure and see MTTR as a first iteration in the ~""group::fulfillment platform"" Grafana Dashboard.


## High-level implementation

Below is an attempt to come-up with a plan to achieve the outcome highlighted above. This is likely to be refined before we start work.

This plan also takes into consideration requirements outlined in [this other issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5579), as there are overlaps between both issues:

1. Update our Prometheus collector
   - Our metrics collector is currently suited for Sidekiq jobs and app/api controllers. We'll have to update it so that it can also capture data when entering / leaving maintenance mode (and when raising Zuora error, wrt to this other issue)
2. Implement new Prometheus collection 
   - Apply actual collection of data in related Health cron jobs and the maintenance rake task.
3. Update [the Runbooks project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)
   - We need to do that so that we can bridge data from Prometheus to new graphs in Grafana

### Issue breakdown

The plan above led to the creation of the following issue breakdown:

1. [ ] [Allow Prometheus collection of maintenance events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5718)
2. [ ] [Add Grafana dashboard to show new MTTR indicator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5725)",8

## Report

#####  Summary

(there is an lack of input validation via email parameter. giving high lenghts will prompt 500 Internal error. making fast requests to the internal server error will make the server down for everyone ! )

#####  Steps to reproduce

(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)

1. Register like any new user. use random details.  
1. The next page should be ( /email_confirmations )   
1. So now upload my payload from the attachement and use it on the email input.   
1. Make sure to send the request in repeater and you receive 500 internal error.  
1. Run turbo intruder or intruder. ( i used turbo-intruder ) good threads then start the attack. 

#####  Impact

(Summarize the impact on users)

No one will be able to login or navigate into Gitlab Customers . the server has been highly affected with only an test attack ! server has been down for long time ! and i believe the same issue will happen on gitlab.com ( official server ) i tried just to get the 500 internal error on the main website and yeah i got it !

####  Impact

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.

The used workflow for the `Customer` record creation uses [FindOrCreateCustomerService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb). This service first attempts to [find a `Customer` record](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L14) via email before [creating a new one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L17) in case none was found. This doesn't add up with the error we are seeing though (since first no record was found but then on creation there suddenly was one). Looking closer into the used emails, it turns out that the two mentioned examples both have a `\t` (some kind of whitespaces) at the end of the email. While it's correct that no `Customer` record is found when looking for one by email, upon attempting to create one, I think devise will automatically strip the whitespace from the email ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/config/initializers/devise.rb#L56)). Which explains why the email already exists error shows up at that step.

### Proposal

Strip any whitespaces before looking for a `Customer` record by email in the `FindOrCreateCustomerService` ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L45)).

### Result

Stripping the whitespace before the lookup will find the already existing `Customer` record and any workflow that is supposed to be executed along with this logic will succeed and not fail anymore.",1

-->

### Problem
Currently the SaaS provisioning subject line does not make it obvious that action needs to be taken.

A change in subject line was first proposed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5003, but this issue is expected to take a long time to deploy given it is blocked by https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8941.

### Proposal

Update the subject line of the SaaS Provisioning email from `[GitLab Transactions] Thanks for purchasing our GitLab.com hosted plan!` to `[GitLab Transactions] Set up your new subscription to get started`.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
Email contains a more obvious CTA, customers know they need to open the email.

### Availability & Testing

<!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.

What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

Please list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.
* Unit test changes
* Integration test changes
* End-to-end test change

See the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning -->

If we do not have one already, we should consider adding a Mailer spec to validate this subject text.

### Problem
For customers who have purchased subscriptions through resellers, we should hide the ""Buy new subscription"" button.

![cdot-sm-subscription-card-crossed](/uploads/268a4f53a15dd0972e6512e9a0559ac0/cdot-sm-subscription-card-crossed.png)

Note: Subscription management buttons will be hidden for reseller subscriptions in this issue - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4946. In the current issue we need to tackle hiding the `Buy new subscription` button.

### Proposal

1. If a customer has an active subscription that was purchased via a Reseller, they **should not be able** to buy a new subscription.
   * Add 30 days to the SubscriptionEndDate of `Active (reseller) subscription` to account for the renewal term
   * 30 days is based on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#late-renewals
1. If a customer purchased via a reseller in the past, and no longer has an active (reseller) subscription, they **should be able** to buy a new subscription.

### Implementation
| MR | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5925       |  Add `managed_by_reseller` attribute to subscription presenter output       |
| https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5926       | Hide `Buy new subscription` button if any of the subscriptions have `managed_by_reseller` true      |

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a

  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5067

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [ ] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)

117713861,2022-10-28 00:14:08.222,[Feature flag] Persist Billing Account related data,"<!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature -->

# Summary

We are introducing logic that will populate `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` as part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950+ given we are going to iteratively add small bits we want to make sure we update at least all the places listed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4795+ before start collecting the data in production.

This issue is to rollout the persistence of the data related to `BillingAccount` and `BillingAccountMembership` currently behind the [`account_data_persistence`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/171/edit) feature flag.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::fulfillment platform"" 
- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_fulfillment_platform`
- Best individual to reach out to: @tyleramos or @vshumilo 
- PM: @mgass1 

## Stakeholders

No other stakeholders.

## The Rollout Plan

Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

Customer's associated billing account is kept up to date with `customer.zuora_account_id`.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

- Disruptive exceptions in the code.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

- Keep an eye on [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/#).
- Check `#s_fulfillment_status` for errors.

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process) - **Lena: Based on the criteria there is no need for change management issue
  Cross link the issue here if it does.**
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [x] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",2
117707761,2022-10-27 20:15:10.704,Create SaaS Subscription Update specific mailer,"## Problem
Today, SaaS customers do not receive an email when they update their subscription (i.e. add seats). This is not a great customer experience, because they have no confirmation that the purchase went through.


## Proposal
Similar to what was done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4543 for Cloud Licensing SM customers, setup a new mailer for subscription updates (e.g. new seats, upgrade plan, etc.) for SaaS customers that:
1. Provides a confirmation to customers that their additional purchase was successful, in a way that makes it clear this was an update/add-on to an existing subscription
1. Gives the customer an audit trail to follow in email

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5057+ will implement a similar email for renewals.

Add the new mailer to the [mailers doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/mailers/index.md).


### Proposed Template

NOTE: this will apply for additional seats, CI Minutes, Storage or an upgrade, so it needs to be somewhat vague.

Hi Courtney👋
Thanks for your GitLab purchase! We appreciate your loyalty as a GitLab customer!

Your purchase will be automatically applied to the same namespace on the start date listed below. Here are the details of your subscription:

1. `product name`
2. `term start date`
2. `term end date`
3. `quantity`

If you require any assistance, contact GitLab support.

Thanks,

The GitLab Team

```

Note: keep the existing link to GitLab Support (https://about.gitlab.com/support/#contact-support) in the last line.

### Technical Requirements

1. Send these mailers for all subscription updates when:
   1. Purchase is of a SaaS subscription
1. Amendment Type is `NewProduct`, `UpdateProduct` or `UpdateSubscription`.
1. Namespace info is present.
   1. If the namespace info is missing the unlinked SaaS purchase email should be used instead.
1. Update logic to send the correct mailer based on subscription type (Renewal, Amendment, New Subscription)
1. Ensure the newer version of the template design is used, consistent with the current New Subscription SaaS purchase email
1. Put the new mailer behind a feature flag ([`new_saas_mailers`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/209/edit), same as used for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5057+) until the voucher email is implemented.

**Note:** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6086+ should be completed directly after this one.

### Result
1. Customer receives an email confirmation when a SaaS product update is completed that clearly outlines an add-on/upgrade occurred.

### Availability & Testing

<!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? -->

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [ ] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [ ] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",1

### Problem

Puma logs are unstructured, unlike those of Rails and Sidekiq. The benefits of structured logs goes without saying.

### Proposal

Add a JSON formatter for Puma, GitLab has one already (implemented [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/38bf33e1ae652b3b752557ecb5da4ecd41d74a42/config/puma.rb.example#L81) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/puma_logging/json_formatter.rb)), so it should be very easy to make the switch.

117652330,2022-10-26 22:38:08.259,Fix GraphQL deprecation warnings,"### Problem

We are getting two GraphQL deprecation warnings:

```
Legacy `.graphql_definition` objects are deprecated and will be removed in GraphQL-Ruby 2.0. Use a class-based definition instead.
```

```
Legacy `.to_graphql` objects are deprecated and will be removed in GraphQL-Ruby 2.0. Remove `.to_graphql` to use a class-based definition instead.
```

These are coming from `spec/support/helpers/graphql_helpers.rb`, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/support/helpers/graphql_helpers.rb#L104) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/support/helpers/graphql_helpers.rb#L155) respectively.

### Proposal

##### Proposal 1
The only tests that use `GraphqlHelpers` is https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/graphql/resolvers/subscription_spec.rb. IMO we should:

1. Move any missing test coverage from the [resolver spec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/graphql/resolvers/subscription_spec.rb) to the [request spec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/requests/graphql/subscription_spec.rb)
2. Remove `GraphqlHelpers`. This helper recreates behavior from the GraphQL gem instead of testing it directly. I don't think this is worth any potential test suite speed increase we may see from using it.

##### Proposal 2

Alternatively, we could probably pull in the latest [`GraphqlHelper` from Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/spec/support/helpers/graphql_helpers.rb)",1

## Proposal

We could look into changing one of these two:
1. Changing the callback from `before_validation` to `after_initialize` ([relevant code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/53b47c47e5ed54c849dc014d8b710d367250cacf/app/models/license.rb#L83))
2. Perform a `valid?` call on the new built license before comparing it to the most recent license ([relevant code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/53b47c47e5ed54c849dc014d8b710d367250cacf/app/services/build_license_from_subscription_service.rb#L43) and [this code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/53b47c47e5ed54c849dc014d8b710d367250cacf/app/services/license_notification_service.rb#L92)).
  - We could even consider calling the `valid?` in the [`License#equal_to?` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/53b47c47e5ed54c849dc014d8b710d367250cacf/app/models/license.rb#L157).",1

CDot can automatically put itself into maintenance mode based on health checks (which include Zuora) but we should still have someone on standby to ensure that CDot goes into and out of maintenance mode as expected.

    - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7929
1. [ ] Set maintenance mode in CustomersDot at 2022-11-13 03:00 UTC
    - This step could be done automatically by CDot.  An engineer could just check that maintenance mode was enabled after Zuora health checks started failing.
1. [ ] Test the maintenance page is working at 2022-11-13 03:00 UTC
1. [ ] Quiet Sidekiq process from [Sidekiq Admin UI](https://customers.gitlab.com/sidekiq/busy) at 7PM PT
    -  This will prevent Sidekiq from processing new queued jobs but jobs will continue to enqueue.
1. [ ] [Ensure the CMOC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#how-to-engage-the-cmoc) has updated status.gitlab.com
1. [ ] Remove maintenance mode in CustomersDot at 2022-11-13 04:00 UTC
    -  This step could be done automatically by CDot.  An engineer could just check that maintenance mode was disabled after Zuora health checks began passing again.
1. [ ] Test the maintenance page is gone at 2022-11-13 04:00 UTC
1. [ ] Manually restart Sidekiq at 2022-11-13 04:00 UTC
    - Connect to CDot production server and run `sudo supervisorctl restart customers-sidekiq` as [documented here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#deployments)
1. [ ] [Ensure the CMOC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#how-to-engage-the-cmoc) has updated status.gitlab.com
1. [ ] Manually enqueue scheduled jobs from [the Recurring Jobs tab](https://customers.gitlab.com/sidekiq/recurring-jobs) missed during maintenance window
    - These were likely the jobs missed based on the planned outage window: 
      - `ExpireOrderCronJob`

### Problem

Now that [preview amendment using orders API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4694) is merged, we can update the workflows to preview using the orders API using a feature flag to control its rollout.

This issue integrates the use of Orders API in reconciliation workflow:

- upcoming reconciliation
- validating quoted invoice during reconciliation

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

In `SendUpcomingReconciliationEmailJob` and `ReconciliationService`, invoke `Zuora::Orders::AmendmentManagerService` if the request is to preview and FF `use_orders_api_to_preview_quoted_invoice_amount` is enabled.

### Result

Orders API is used in reconciliation workflow as a replacement to Amend API.

114125773,2022-08-30 06:24:13.768,Add data mapping for Arrowsphere,"### Background:

Previously Arrow system talks to Gitlab Platypus API endpoint(and then Platypus talks to CustomersDot). We will remove Platypus in this communication chain.

* previously(as of today): `Arrow -> Platypus -> CustomersDot`
* after removing Platypus, Arrow will directly talk to CustomersDot: `Arrow -> CustomersDot`

In order to achieve this, there are several changes required on CustomersDot side.

1. implement OAuth provider in CustomersDot. This allows secure API access control. We propose to use `doorkeeper` gem.
1. add required data mapping in CustomersDot. This maps some Arrow payload data to the CustomersDot/Zuora/SFDC required values.
1. track the Arrow order status. The status is used to:  allow Arrow to poll the order status; validate duplicate requests; ensure to take action safely only on the right order status.
1. provide API endpoint for Arrow to poll the order status.

For more information, refer to the task breakdown at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4637#note_1062429151.

### This issue's scope

This issue covers the second task `add required data mapping in CustomersDot`

#### Proposal
Below are required mappings. Refer to [Arrow to Platypus mapping column](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138UqGiYfGc8A4HyBin6JrsRelmjfGbqvg3UZ0nJaLTU/edit#gid=0&range=B1) to find the information on how to map these values.
   * externalSubscriptionSource: generated based on authenticated client(ATM the value is `Arrowsphere`)
      - Once doorkeeper authentication succeeds, we could get from `doorkeeper_token.application.name`. (when creating the OAuth application, set the application name as `Arrowsphere`)

### This issue's scope

This issue covers the first task `implement OAuth provider in CustomersDot`

#### Proposal
   * Use `doorkeeper` gem. Follow the documentation https://doorkeeper.gitbook.io/guides/ to configure and coding. 
     * For the marketplace, we only need to secure API endpoint. So only support `client_credentials` flow is OK.
     * Configure scope(s)
     * **Question**: it seems we do not need to configure resource_owner_authenticator to secure API?
       * I skipped this part in my local configuration, and it works. All resource_owner_id is `null` in the `oauth_access_tokens` table. As in API, we only care about the client itself.
       * **Answer** I believe so for `client_credentials`.
          * The `client_credentials` grant type provides an application with a way to access its own service account. 
          * Marketplace application's `own service account` is the this Marketplace provider(e.g. Arrow)'s Zuora account. Once authenticated, the application has access to resources belonging to the Zuora subscriptions whose `invoice owner account is the Marketplace provider's Zuora account`. For example, such resources could be `status` in `MarketplaceOrder` table, Zuora subscriptions, etc.
          * In CustomersDot, one easy and reliable way to check whether a Zuora subscription is owned by a Marketplace provider is: check the `Zuora subscription's external_subscription_source == Marketplace provider's name`
          * In `POST /v1/orders`, we should always set the `external_subscription_source` -- We already did this.
          * In `GET /v1/orders/{external_subscription_id}`, we should only search subscriptions with `external_subscription_source == the Marketplace provider's name`.
          * The `Marketplace provider's name` should be discovered by `doorkeeper_token.application.name`. **NOTE**: for security reasons, we should **NEVER get this value from user input**(such as: request URL, request header, or request body). We should **ALWAYS get the value from the valid access_token**. This is important to ensure one Marketplace provider cannot create/query resources owned by other Marketplace providers.-- ATM we only have `Arrowsphere`, but in the future, we could have more Marketplace providers.
   * Generate `client_id`/`client_secret`(with `scope`) and send to Arrow.
     * we can do this through rails console `Doorkeeper::Application.create(name: ""MyApp"", redirect_uri: """", scopes: [""marketplace_order_create""])`
   * Arrow: update `client_id`/`client_secret`/`scope` generated from CDot

# Bug

For customers already associated with a Zuora account, the default payment ID needs to be set before creating a subscription.

If not, the subscription creation will result in the error: `To collect payment, the customer account must have a default payment method.`

`SubscribeService` [updated default payment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9d9d6d56f56d596e0f98c52009e2a3638575f1c7/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L20) before making a [subscription request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9d9d6d56f56d596e0f98c52009e2a3638575f1c7/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L22) if the customer already has a Zuora account associated. This likely got missed when migrating to Orders API.

In addition, `CreationFollowupService` also needs to update the default payment ID (as done [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9d9d6d56f56d596e0f98c52009e2a3638575f1c7/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L195) in SubscribeService).

As part of the fix also update `OrderManagerService` spec to use `:with_zuora_account` trait (see [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5290#note_1078327840)).

### Problem

Similar to the other Order actions implemented to renew a subscription, add, update and remove a product, we need an Order action to update [Terms and conditions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Terms_and_Conditions_of_a_Subscription?_gl=1%2A1l4o63o%2A_ga%2AMzk3MTU1OTE4LjE2NDgwNjkzODE.%2A_ga_MY8CQ650DH%2AMTY2MTI2MzQ2My4yMTYuMS4xNjYxMjYzNTgzLjAuMC4w&_ga=2.3888562.30517363.1661062519-397155918.1648069381) of a subscription.

In the current workflow, terms and conditions of a subscription are updated when a subscription is auto-renewed ([source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3c782065f5922a8b54c1ebec1449d4f1f0edabe8/app/services/amend_subscription_service.rb#L141)).

### Proposal

In the module `app/services/zuora/orders/actions`, create a service class `UpdateTermsAndConditions`.

The service implements the following:

* inherits `Zuora::Orders::Actions::BaseService`
* defines `.execute` method that accepts `params` and instantiates an object of the class and invoked `#execute`
* defines `#execute` method

The `#execute` method constructs `orderAction` object to update terms and conditions of a subscription, with the below parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `type` | String | Constant value: `TermsAndConditions` |
| `triggerDates` | Array of Objects | Each object has the keys: `name` and `triggerDate`. Defines `ContractEffective`, `ServiceActivation` and `CustomerAcceptance` dates as appropriate (see what dates existing workflow implements)|
| `auto_renew` | Boolean | Based on user input (included in `params`) |

Params are set in accordance to the current logic for updating terms and conditions in `AmendSubscriptionService`, please verify if any other param is set in existing implementation.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result

The service constructs the `orderActions` object to update terms and conditions of a subscription.

### Problem

Similar to amendment preview (before the actual purchase), we need a way to use the Orders API to preview an amendment.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

113533862,2022-08-19 14:36:12.404,Refactor can_activate_cloud_license logic,"### Problem
The current activation code logic includes a check for eligibility: `can_activate_cloud_license?`

This eligibility is currently dependent on the other Super Sonics fields being populated. This is causing problems and is not a relevant dependency.

### Proposal
Remove this SS dependency to ease the creation of activation codes.

In the check for `can_activate_cloud_license?` ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fe7feb2659aff9cd2bf60e998e91c042462a29c8/app/models/subscription.rb#L461)), remove:

* `ContractSeatReconciliation__c` is not `null`
* `ContractAutoRenew__c` is not `null`
* `ContractOperationalMetrics__c` is not `null`
* The method `Subscription#can_activate_cloud_license?` would only check for `self_service?` which can be used directly instead


### Result
In tandem with https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4688, this will remove the dependency of the other SS fields being populated on the creation of a cloud license activation code.

# Bug

## Summary

While purchasing new subscriptions, the price is determined based on the quantity of a service or product purchased.

The current implementation uses [`recurringVolume`](spec/services/zuora/orders/entities/subscribe_to_rate_plans_spec.rb) pricing, while it should use [Per Unit Charge Model](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Product_Catalog/B_Charge_Models#Per_Unit_Charge_Model).

Per the [docs](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Product_Catalog/B_Charge_Models#Per_Unit_Charge_Model) for Per Unit Charge Model:

> With the per unit charge model, the amount to charge is expressed as a price per unit. The price is calculated based on the quantity of a service or product purchased by the customer, where the total price charged per period would be the quantity multiplied by the per-unit price. An example of a per unit charge would be a software-as-a-service vendor that charges $50 per user per month for their service.

> Per unit pricing can be used with one-time, recurring, or usage charges.

[Docs](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Product_Catalog/B_Charge_Models#Volume_Pricing_Charge_Model) for Volume Pricing Charge Model:

> With a volume pricing charge model, the price to be charged is based on the volume purchased. When setting up a volume charge model, a price table is used to define the pricing for each range of volumes, as well as the pricing rule to apply if the customer purchases a quantity that falls within the range of that tier. Each tier is defined by a starting unit, an ending unit, a list price, and a price format (which can be either flat fee or per unit).

Please note that this is **currently not impacting** the existing new subscriptions purchased:

  1. When additional CI minutes is purchased for a new customer (having no prior subscriptions). It uses Order's API workflow for new subscriptions, and the pricing model is `One-Time - Per Unit Pricing`.

![Screen_Shot_2022-08-18_at_9.20.16_AM](/uploads/71a3a5c8377b6a01c68d33403c4e0c8f/Screen_Shot_2022-08-18_at_9.20.16_AM.png)

- [Verification walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfBlfMUtXaUK8P4PJg2OayPbz9R_gM3C/view?usp=sharing)

 2. When customer purchases new subscription for a plan. It uses Order's API workflow for new subscriptions, and the pricing model is `Recurring - Per Unit Pricing`.

- [Link to Subscription](https://test.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a8aa0a082aa6f8c0182ade15fc915f6)
- [Verification walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpRbusMjgNbMczWDinx9AV8ZboNy0q3i/view?usp=sharing)

This is likely due to the fact that the request also includes [`product_rate_plan_charge_id`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/6909e8dfb20722b24f3fbbcf4ea07ba8d5a37a9d/app/services/zuora/orders/entities/subscribe_to_rate_plans.rb#L38) (confirmation pending).

## Steps to reproduce

(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)

1. Navigate to the billing page of a namespace in gitlab.com
2. Select a plan and enter pricing details
3. Verify the request defines pricing model as `recurringVolume`

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Although no impact was observed in the subscriptions created in Zuora, the pricing model in the request needs update.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

New subscriptions should be created with `Per Unit Pricing` pricing model.

- for add-ons (CI minutes, storage): use `One-Time - Per Unit Pricing`
- for plans: use `Recurring - Per Unit Pricing`

### Problem

Currently, some of the text displayed on the Subscription Admin Page and Admin Overview page within a self-managed subscription is confusing to customers.
* The text ""Renews: in X days"" is confusing/alarming to customers:
  * Who are not on auto-renew - this is not accurate as they actually will lose access
  * Who have already purchased a renewal subscription that is an upgrade from their current - this is not accurate
* The text ""Valid From"" isn't very clear - saying something simpler may be clearer to customers
* ""Expires on"" is harsh, and can imply the end of a subscription even if a customer has already renewed

### Proposal

#### Changes on the Admin > Subscription page

Update the following text under `Subscription details` to reduce customer confusion:
1. Change `Renews` to `End date`
1. Change the End date format from an relative date (eg, `in 11 days`) to an absolute date (eg, `2022-08-06`)
1. Change `Started` to `Start date`
1. Change `Last Sync` to `Last sync` (sentence case)
1. Update the order to be:
     - Start date
     - End date
     - Last sync


Update the following text under `Subscription History`:
1. Change ""Valid From"" to ""Start date""
2. Change ""Expires On"" to ""End date""
3. Change ""Activated on"" to ""Activation date""

1. Change `Expires` to `End date`

### Problem

Introduce `AmendmentManagerService` that will serve as an entry point for amendment workflow.

The purpose of this service is to:
  - determine the order action types for the request (based on `params`)
  - verify feature availability for the determined order action types
  - trigger order manager service if feature availability passed

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create `ActionTypeGenerator` that determines possible order action types. Create `AmendmentManagerService` that does the following:

  - invokes `ActionTypeGenerator` to get possible order action types. If no order actions were found, return an error response so we can fallback to existing amendment workflow.
  - run feature availability on the order action types
  - trigger order manager service if feature availability returns `true`. If `false`, return an error response so we can fallback to existing amendment workflow.

For the options that are needed in `UpdateProduct` we can either pass the options directly from `AmendSubscriptionService` or pass params to a `FilterService` which returns the required options.

note: `AmendSubscriptionService` handles multiple amendments in a single call, we need to check if we can replace individual amendment actions with the new order service or do we need to wait for all actions to be implemented before we can integrate the new order service.

# Feature Request

## Problem

<!-- Describe the problem in terms which a user may understand. Avoid providing solutions in this section -->

As part of the changes made in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4035, we added to the header that the selection of cancellation reason is optional. See before/after here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4035#note_971075680

This then lead to a drop in responses as outlined in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4035#note_1052667342

## Proposal

<!-- Describe the proposed solution the problem -->

We'd like to remove the `(optional)` from the top header, so instead of
`Could you tell us a bit more about your cancellation? (optional)`

It should read 
`Could you tell us a bit more about your cancellation?`

Note that the actual selection should continue to be optional, just like it has always been, and we shouldn't block the form submission on requiring them to select an option.

# Summary

<!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. -->

This issue is to rollout [Order preview for new subscriptions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4476) on CustomersDot production,
that is currently behind the [`use_orders_api_preview_subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/150/edit) feature flag.

- PM: @tgolubeva 

## Stakeholders

<!--
Are there any other stages or teams involved that need to be kept in the loop?

- GITLAB_HANDLE of a PM
- The Support Team
- The Delivery Team
-->

## The Rollout Plan

- Partial Rollout with specific Customers on CustomersDot, [via Unleash](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#user-ids)
- Rollout on CustomersDot for a certain period (How long)
- Percentage Rollout on CustomersDot
- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can also be useful to review -->

## Testing User/Customer IDs

<!--
List any Customer IDs for Customers that are happy to have this feature turned on early.

Remove if not applicable
-->

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

<!-- Describe the expected outcome when rolling out this feature -->

When customer's preview subscription before purchase, the request in the backend uses Zuora's [Preview an Order API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) instead of Subscribe API.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

<!-- Should the feature flag be turned off? Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen? What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? -->

Customer's may not be able to preview subscription accurately before purchase.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? -->

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [ ] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",2

Customers were able to add their [license file during installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/license_file.html#add-your-license-file-during-installation) of their GitLab instance when using a legacy license. With Cloud License this is no longer possible. 

Please note more details in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383878

### Workaround

Request an [offline cloud license](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/cloud-licensing/#offline-cloud-licensing), which can be applied during installation.

### Proposal

Add the ability to add activation code during the installation of a GitLab instance, similar to what was possible for legacy licenses: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/license_file.html#add-your-license-file-during-installation.

### Problem

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4326 implemented Order action `Zuora::Orders::Actions:: RenewSubscription` that constructs the request body to renew a subscription.

The next step is to use this order action in `OrderManagerService` to renew a subscription.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

:warning: Depends on [AmendmentManagerService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5254) to be complete.

- Use `ActionTypesGenerator` to determine if a request pertains to renewing a subscription: see separate issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4723
- Integrate `RenewSubscription` order action with OrderManagerService: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5290

### Result

When renewing a subscription, there are other order actions involved: Adding a Product, Removing a product, Updating a product.

Consequently, the renewal workflow will not be e2e complete with this issue. However, we can use it to test a subscription is getting renewed without any seat / product changes.

112811238,2022-08-04 18:29:52.757,Remove Customer dependency from Subscription model,"### Problem

In CustomersDot, a `Subscription` model exists as a wrapper around a `Zuora::Subscription` object.  This wrapper is meant to contain business logic specific to CustomersDot.  The `Subscription` class has an initialization dependency on having a `Customer` record ([see code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/99ecaa74572bcf1542b5ab9fadba3f410b402b18/app/models/subscription.rb#L93)).  This dependency does not seem to be necessary and only adds to the complexity in our system.  

In most places, the `Customer` record is used simply as a way to determine the `zuora_account_id` for the subscription, but we should be getting this directly from the `Zuora::Subscription` instead.  In other places, it is used to determine who should receive provisioning emails, but this can also be determined from using Zuora (the Sold To contact of the Zuora Account).

### Proposal

Identify and update all places where the `customer` is referenced from the `Subscription` object, and eventually remove the dependency altogether.  We can start with the easy references where customer is used to get the `zuora_account_id`.

### Result

A much cleaner and understandable `Subscription` class.  This will also enable us to rely more on Zuora data and less on the customer data in CDot which helps towards the initiative in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8331.",8
125858767,2022-08-04 10:09:12.035,Provide the ability in CustomerDot to send a cloud activation code to another account,"[[_TOC_]]

## Step 1: Describe what this request is about by answering the following questions

### What is the problem/opportunity?  

Currently, in CustomerDot it is only possible to send a cloud activation code to the account owner. As shown below:

![image](/uploads/0fdf44b7bdc349f621367210a72fa5e8/image.png)

![image](/uploads/80ce6c24028fc7bd256d5c5e27596018/image.png)

However, it is possible to forward a license file to another account

![image](/uploads/d43104b38e2113e346b7550189bc715b/image.png)


This problem was exposed by a customer in a [zendesk ticket](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/310143) when the account owner was on vacation and the other users did not have access to GitLab as a result. 

### Who is it for?

       1. External: SM customers


### Why is this important?

It is important that CustomerDot provides the parity of functionality for Cloud Licensing Activation Codes that it does for Offline/legacy licenses 

### How do you propose we solve for it?

Create forward license activation code functionality


### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

CustomerDot provides the ability to send the Activation Code to another email

## Proposal
Implement the same process used today by legacy licenses.

### Availability & Testing

<!-- This section needs to be retained and filled in during the workflow planning breakdown phase of this feature proposal, if not earlier.

What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?

Please list the test areas (unit, integration and end-to-end) that needs to be added or updated to ensure that this feature will work as intended. Please use the list below as guidance.
* Unit test changes
* Integration test changes
* End-to-end test change

See the test engineering planning process and reach out to your counterpart Software Engineer in Test for assistance: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/test-engineering/#test-planning -->

We will need to create many lower-level tests including, but not limited to:

- Unit specs
- Controller specs
- Jest specs
- Email validity
- Likely Model validation specs(?) [are we validating email via the model, controller?]
- Feature specs
- Mailer specs(?) [test that the email has indeed been sent to the appropriate email]

Other things to consider:

- When the customer adds a new email, are we saving this email somewhere, so it can be sent later from a list of valid emails?
- What email validation regex are we going to be using? Will this validation regex allow wildcard emails? (e.g.: ddavison+fulfillment[at]gitlab.com)",3
112753832,2022-08-03 21:27:42.075,Order should be rejected if an existing customer tries to purchase through Arrow,"### Problem

We identified when discussing the [scorecard for UAT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1innM5QJP11Cc_0yuejYCkgyFqWrsuShgMG_pG-iN43s/edit#gid=0) as a group that orders need to be rejected when an existing customer attempts to make a purchase through Arrowsphere.  There are a few reasons for this:

1. We don't want to allow existing Customers with access to the Customer Portal to be able to make a purchase via Arrowsphere and allow them to manage their subscription through the Portal.
2. Customers may be looking to make adjustments to existing subscriptions through Arrowsphere by mistake.  By preventing this action, we are saving some headache and directing them to the sales-assisted route.

### Proposal

If a Customer record already exists, reject a subscription from being created through the marketplace subscriptions API.

We got clarification from the team that CustomersDot should block an Order if a Customer record exists with the email address (Sold To) and has an associated Zuora Account.  That means even if the Customer record was created through an earlier Arrowsphere order, it will still be rejected.",1
112703434,2022-08-03 07:05:25.367,Refactor SubscriptionSerializer in License creation,"This is a refactoring suggestion to merge `SubscriptionSerializer` with `License` model.

`SubscriptionSerializer` was originally created to serialize Zuora callback data so we can send it to LicenseApp for creating a license.

LicenseDot is now merged with CDot, so its only usage is in `License#build_from_subscription`. We can consider it as an unnecessary layer of abstraction, with readability drawback: we can't easily tell how Zuora callback attributes are mapped to License record. Additional attribute name aliases were also introduced by this serializer, adding more cognitive load.

## Proposal

Two opposite proposals:

1. inline `SubscriptionSerializer` into `License#build_from_subscription` 
2. turn `SubscriptionSerializer` into a License factory, which would replace `License#build_from_subscription`",2

### Problem

Our installation guide has a section for installing PostgreSQL via Homebrew and via `asdf`. So we have two tools for installing two things and that might cause problems like if you installed everything via Homebrew and then decided to switch to `asdf`. Which database will be used in this case? The answer is unknown.

### Proposal

Let's switch to a single tool for installing our dependencies. GDK and CustomersDot as well as other projects in GitLab uses `adsf` as default tool for managing runtimes. GDK also uses `asdf` to install the correct PostgreSQL version so we should to the same to eliminate possible discrepancies and simplify our setup documentation.",1

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [ ] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [ ] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

This issue is to cleanup the `tracking_subscription_management` feature flag, after the feature flag has been enabled by default for an appropriate amount of time in production.

The feature flag is enabling/disabling frontend and backend tracking for all subscription management events for SaaS and SM subscriptions.

## Owners

- Team: ~25005342  
- Most appropriate slack channel to reach out to: `#g_billing_and_subscription`
- Best individual to reach out to: @dzubova
- PM: @tgolubeva  

## Expectations

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

### Cleaning up the feature flag

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `:tracking_subscription_management` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)",1

### Problem

As part of the [Orders API upgrade](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6438) efforts, we've implemented a design pattern to structure the Order related services.

- `OrderManagerService` as the entry point for triggering a request to create an order. Based on the type of order operation (such as creating a new subscription, renewing, cancelling a subscription, updating a product, etc.), the `OrderManagerService` internally invokes the `order action` services that generate the parameters required to perform the operation
- `orders/actions` contain services pertaining to order actions
- `orders/entities` construct particular entity object (that can be shared and re-used by multiple order actions). For e.g. `NewAccount`, `RatePlan` object.
- `orders/custom_fields` generate custom fields for subscription, account, orders

111030070,2022-07-01 14:54:11.332,Set invoice owner for marketplace,"## Problem statement

For subscriptions originating from marketplace, the invoice owner needs to be set to be explicitly set ([reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/22a611f9c8795a7d9b7796c302bbbfee2cdf6650/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L138)). This needs to be incorporated in the Orders API workflow.

## Proposed solution

@qzhaogitlab helped investigating a way to set the invoice owner using the [Change owner of subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription#Use_the_REST_API) Order action.

From https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5011#note_1013232946:

Per some Zuora documentation, I tend to think this is not possible.

* from [Preview an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.258925834.1822949724.1656638338-1336953299.1647685508&_gl=1*1h2399g*_ga*MTMzNjk1MzI5OS4xNjQ3Njg1NTA4*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1NjY2NDQ4MC40OC4xLjE2NTY2NjQ5NDIuMA..#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) section, it says:

> existingAccountNumber string <= 70 characters The account number that this order will be created under. It can be either the accountNumber or the account info. It will return an error if both are specified. Note that invoice owner account of the subscriptions included in this order should be the same with the account of the order.

* from [Create an order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/?_ga=2.258925834.1822949724.1656638338-1336953299.1647685508&_gl=1*1h2399g*_ga*MTMzNjk1MzI5OS4xNjQ3Njg1NTA4*_ga_MY8CQ650DH*MTY1NjY2NDQ4MC40OC4xLjE2NTY2NjQ5NDIuMA..#operation/POST_Order), it says:

> existingAccountNumber string <= 70 characters The account number that this order will be created under. It can be either the accountNumber or the account info provided. It will return an error if both are specified. Note that this actually specifies the invoice owner account of the subscriptions included in this order.

> newAccount object (Account) The information of the new account to be created with the order. Note that this actually specifies the invoice owner account of the subscriptions included in this order. To create the new account, either a creditCard structure or the hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId field (but not both) should be provided. The one provided becomes the default payment method for this account. If the credit card information is declined or can't be verified, then the account is not created.

* from [Overview of orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders), it says:

> The following components represent an Order:
>
> Order A contractual agreement between a merchant and a customer. One order can affect multiple subscriptions and order line items which belong to the same invoice owner account. These subscriptions and order line items can be owned by multiple customers.

From the above documentations, it sounds to me, both `preview order` and `create order` do NOT allow setting `invoice account` explicitly (Zuora will set the `invoice account` to the same value as `subscription owner account` by default).

So I think, for the marketplace `invoice owner` setting, we will have to create another Order to [change the subscription owner](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Change_the_Owner_of_a_Subscription#Use_the_REST_API). I had a quick try, it works:

```

111007464,2022-07-01 08:03:47.966,Add feature tests for form submit preventing logic,"We want to make sure the newly added logic that prevents the form from being submitted when emojis are present is also tested at the integration level.

The reason is that while the unit test [in here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/frontend/sessions/register_form_spec.js#L134) gives some confidence about the Register form behaviour, (as [suggested](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4887#note_1012878978)) an integration test would yield a result closer to the real-life behaviour.

### Proposed solution

It should be sufficient to add an expectation to the current set of tests [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/spec/features/customer_sign_up_spec.rb).

113533122,2022-06-30 22:16:58.442,Remove cloud compatible check and add GitLab EE check,"## Background
Currently, cloud license activation codes are generated only when a customer is ""eligible"". Eligibility is systematically determined based on the status ""Super Sonics"" fields:

* An activation code (`cloud activation`) will be created for a SM plan [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8baa35bbd603bf60a75a6981da4f1fbb70abe934/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L21) if the following conditions are fulfilled (see [this method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fe7feb2659aff9cd2bf60e998e91c042462a29c8/app/models/subscription.rb#L401)):
   * A cloud license can be activated ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/fe7feb2659aff9cd2bf60e998e91c042462a29c8/app/models/subscription.rb#L461)) which means one of the following condition should be true:
     * the subscription was self serviced (subscription bought via CustomersDot)
     * `ContractSeatReconciliation__c` is not `null`
     * `ContractAutoRenew__c` is not `null`
     * `ContractOperationalMetrics__c` is not `null`

   * The subscription is cloud compatible ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d1f1aac64a4b6cb99bbf47838d1fde5116b6468b/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L47)) which means `TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` is present.
If the above is met, the customer will receive either the unified mailer or the activation code mailer, and also have the option to copy the activation code from the subscription in CustomersDot. If not, we are assuming the customer is on the old terms (purchase completed prior to 2022-08-01), and not creating or providing an activation code.

## Proposal
Remove the dependency on the Super Sonics fields in order to generate a cloud license. Instead, generate an activation code for all customers where `TurnOnCloudLicensing` is not = `No`.

Specifically, remove the following conditions:

* Remove check for subscription is cloud compatible ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/d1f1aac64a4b6cb99bbf47838d1fde5116b6468b/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L47))
  * Refactor logic around [SubscriptionCloudCompatibleVersionFinder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/8260397dabda85e49c6b7642892c9fd83496fa63/lib/subscription_cloud_compatible_version_finder.rb) & rename

* When removing the cloud license compatible check on manual offline cloud license creation ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fbeeb5178fe0f004d18e772b70af7b271fcb74ba/app/services/rails_admin/create_license_service.rb#L154)), add a condition that checks the license belongs to a GitLab EE plan now as an extra safety 

## Why 
There is a bug in SFDC that is resulting in the Super Sonics fields occasionally being cleared out. Details of this issue are captured [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4599) and we are working with Sales Systems to correct this problem as part of this epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1886.
* ~~This is reducing adoption of Cloud Licensing as these customers are receiving only the Legacy mailer (which does NOT have an activation code) and they cannot access the activation code from within CustomersDot~~
* This is actually causing customers to receive the activation code mailer _without_ a cloud license attached, which is a terrible customer experience, and could result in us recognizing revenue at the wrong time.

In looking at New and Renewal quotes created after 2022-08-01, about 390 have these fields blanked out.

This also impacts their Customer Portal experience and prevents the customer from accessing their activation code there, so these customers are then downloading legacy licenses from the portal and activating with that.

### Problem

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4961 introduced the following custom attributes: `SSPChannel__c` and `Entity__c` and set `IsInvoiceSeparate = true` for all Marketplace subscriptions.

This change needs to be incorporated for Orders API.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create custom attributes service class for New account and set the values appropriately. Consider moving the methods to subscription helper class.


### Result

The newly introduced custom attributes are set in the Orders workflow.",2
110942114,2022-06-30 07:31:17.350,Missing condition when creating missing cloud activation in admin area,"### Problem

While looking into the code logic for the cloud activation creation, it was found that the checks for the automatic workflow (when a subscription callback comes from Zuora to CustomersDot) differ from the ones in place for the admin area workflow to create a missing cloud activation.

The automatic workflow [checks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L416-418) three conditions:
1. Does the subscription have a GitLab EE plan? ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L190))
2. Is the subscription cloud license compatible? ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/lib/zuora/subscription.rb#L47))
   * `TurnOnSeatReconciliation__c` is set
3. Can the subscription be cloud license activated? ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L475)) Which requires one of the following condition to return `true`:
   * the subscription was self serviced (subscription bought via CustomersDot)
   * `ContractSeatReconciliation__c` is not `null`
   * `ContractAutoRenew__c` is not `null`
   * `ContractOperationalMetrics__c` is not `null`

The admin area workflow [checks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L440-441) contain the checks from 1. and 2. but are missing 3. 

### Proposal

Align both workflows to do the same checks to ensure a cloud activation can only be created for eligible subscriptions. To do this, the [checks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L440-441) for the admin area workflow have to contain the check for a subscription to be cloud license activated ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/bd99d8091d28f26aa62eec6578495da0a3ee9cbd/app/models/subscription.rb#L475)).

To ensure later modifications will be applied to both workflows, the three checks could be moved to their own method to be easily reused in the two workflows.

### Result

The automatic workflow and the admin area workflow are aligned with the checks for eligible subscriptions when checking if a cloud activation needs to be created.",1
110930718,2022-06-30 01:06:40.886,Revert PaymentTerm setting for Marketplace Zuora account,"### Problem

Per [this discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4081#note_1011074254): we do not need to set Marketplace end user Zuora account `PaymentTerm` differently.

> the payment term only needs to be set on the Invoice Owner Account (Arrowsphere: Net 30 EOM). The payment term of the end user is irrelevant.

### Proposal

To clean up the code logic, we should revert related changes:
- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/55a49713a3cd40a12e1334f7ba7fae4d6b5ffae2/app/services/zuora/helpers/subscription.rb#L24-29

After revert, all paymentTerm will be the default value `DEFAULT_PAYMENT_TERM = 'Due Upon Receipt'`

Similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3185+, we should set correct subscription fields when Community Programs subscription renews, but ONLY if these fields have not been set already.

If the following fields are already set (from when the new subscription was created), do not change them.

110910907,2022-06-29 15:34:03.740,Prevent subscription purchase when quantity is invalid,"### Problem

When user enters 0 as quantity during subscription purchase, subscription purchase/claim CTA is enabled even if quantity is invalid and user can successfully buy the subscription despite the invalid quantity entered. The subscription purchased is for the previous valid quantity entered. For example, user enters 3 for quantity, then changes to 0, clicks on Buy subscription - this will successfully create a subscription for 3 users.

OR, if you wanted to keep it as-is, you could pass the attributes in `initialize`. This would allow you to set attr_readers for `external_subscription_source` and `external_subscription_id`. You could also break up this execute method a bit more this way. For instance, `access_token` could be it's own method.

    > **Question:** Will this logic for processing payments be captured in a later MR?  I'm just curious and totally fine if it's not included in this MR. :smile:

### Problem statement

Similar to how processing payment options are included in [Subscribe api](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/90fc752163c1f6f83cc104773b30289226ca166c/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L103), we need a mechanism to set this in Orders API.

### Proposed solution

Cross posting the inferences from [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4446#note_1012628875):

In the subscribe api, the following options are sent in `subscribe_options` object:

```ruby
subscribeOptions: {
  generateInvoice: true,
  processPayments: <true if no coupon is used or if not marketplace>,
  subscribeInvoiceProcessingOptions: {
    invoiceDate: <current date>,
    invoiceProcessingScope: 'Subscription',
    invoiceTargetDate: <current date>
  }
}
```

While trying to map to Orders API, the following is what I was able to infer based on the description:
| Subscribe API | Orders API | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| `generateInvoice` | `runBilling` | |
| `processPayments` | `collectPayment` | |
| `InvoiceDate` | `documentDate` | |
| `InvoiceDate` | `targetDate` | |

Use the [Preview an order API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder) for the preview workflow.

This is 3 step process:

110629231,2022-06-23 18:12:37.709,Backfill to sync missing namespace data from CustomersDot to SFDC,"## Problem

We recently identified a set of subscriptions with missing namespace fields.  This results in SFDC users unable to generate complete reports or view relevant customer subscription data.

## Background 
The likely causes for missing data values are as follows:
1. Zuora data null prior to ([sync integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1989)) implementation - expected since the work was move forward only. Technical work would be to backfill the data from GitLab.com-CustomersDot data.
1. Zuora data null post implementation - could be one of two causes:
   - Sales-assisted subscription in which the customer hasn't connected their namespace to the subscription yet. There's no technical work here.
   - Data sync issue, somewhere between Zuora-CustomersDot-GitLab.com, data is out of sync. Technical work would be to find the data issue, resolve it, and push the data to Zuora.
1. SFDC data null prior to the [latest work](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/314) to bring the data in (I'm not sure of the date tbh) - I'd defer to the team who implemented the work, I'm not sure if they backfilled data which existed in Zuora.
1. SFDC data null post the latest work to bring the data in. - would be the same root cause as 2.2 above

## Proposal

Create a process to backfill missing namespace field values.

### Problem

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4382 created a service that generates custom attributes required for new Subscription order action.

The [Orders API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) requires subscription custom attributes to be sent in the `subscriptions` object:

```
{
  orderDate: ...,
  ...
  subscriptions: [
    {
      customFields: {

      },
      orderActions: [],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

In [OrderManagerService](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/d1f43892b1be3add5afba0f9f55a1719a9cb6470/app/services/zuora/orders/order_manager_service.rb), invoke the service `Zuora::Orders::CustomFields::CreateSubscription.new(customer: customer, params: params).execute` when order action is of New Subscription type.

### Result

### Problem
We need to add a feature spec to verify the URL navigation behavior with the new [Vue cancelation modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/62e7646f3ba331c9892ff5f31d52207aaac5ac55/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/cancellation_modal.vue). Thread [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4910#note_1000412840). 

Also remove [this unit test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4910/diffs?diff_id=419419267#f07ba46d14657e90fe9c115cec0bd944f7d112e7_195_223) since the feature spec will better cover that scenario.

### Proposal
Add a test identical/very similar to [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/62e7646f3ba331c9892ff5f31d52207aaac5ac55/spec/features/existing_customers/renewal_spec.rb#L25) that uses the new Vue cancellation modal. 

### Result
We have better coverage of the new Vue cancel modal behavior when the user cancels their subscription.",1
110624142,2022-06-23 16:16:40.499,Use current subscription instead of active for Ramp subscriptions when downloading/copying license,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3969, we updated the provisioning logic in CDot to support SM ramp subscriptions.  This involved using the `Subscription.build` method in places where licenses are provisioned like when activating a Cloud subscription or when processing a Zuora callout.  The `Subscription.build` method can build a ramped `Subscription` object with products from the current ramp interval rather than using the latest/active subscription information.  For instance, if interval 1 had a quantity of 5 and interval 3 had a quantity of 20, the license would be generated initially with a quantity of 5.

However, when downloading/copying a license from the CustomersDot Manage Subscriptions page, this Subscription is loaded without this logic, so the license will always use the active/last interval quantity (e.g. 20).  

## Proposal 
For Ramp subscriptions only, update the download/copy action for a Self Managed subscription on the `Manage Purchases` page to use the `Subscription.build` method. This will ensure only the current ramp interval is used.  

This issue is related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3916+ where we are considering UX changes in CDot related to ramp subscriptions.",1
110546787,2022-06-22 12:46:25.932,Add ability to use Zuora Data Query,"### Problem

The [gem `iron_bank`](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/) that we use as a third party tool to connect CustomersDot to Zuora doesn't support complex query (like joining two data models). To find eligible subscriptions in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4405+, we need to use a complex query. The query will use the `Subscription` as the main data model and join the `Account` and `Contact` data models to get to the data we need for the mentioned issue (to send reminder emails to instance admin/sold to contacts of a subscription).

With IronBank that isn't possible, but with [Zuora's Data Query](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/platform/data-query), this can be achieved (also see [API docs](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Data-Queries)).

One thing to note is that Data Query is async and will not return the result directly.

### Proposal

Add the ability to use Zuora's Data Query.

### Result

The complex query needed for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4405 can be done with the help of Zuora Data Query.",3

We have alerts in our code base that we show we customer **upgrades to** the deprecated subscription type (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Starter) that are eligible for discounts. Right now there is no valid case when we should show it (see [internal slack thread](url)).

### Problem

When creating a new order, the account details can be provided by specifying either of the two attributes: `existingAccountNumber` or `newAccount`.

As the name suggests, `existingAccountNumber` is used for an existing account, and `newAccount` for a new account.

While OrderManagerService currently supports pass the [`existingAccountNumber`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/618359c09943f0c8716ad277b6c546562c103d40/app/services/zuora/orders/order_manager_service.rb#L40), we need a mechanism to send the `newAccount` object for new customers.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create an entity that constructs account object. It should return existing or new data based on whether the customer has an account or not.

110207920,2022-06-16 04:26:13.687,Add fields to GraphQL API to support community program management in GitLab,"### Problem

This is foundational work for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363439+ and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363440+.

We need to know what date a subscription is eligible for renewal from and whether or not the subscription can have seats added to it so that we can show the correct UI to the user, at the correct time for self managing their subscriptions in GitLab.

Currently this information is hard-coded in the GitLab codebase, but with the introduction of community programs, the renewal dates are different and not all subscriptions are eligible to have their seat count modified.

### Proposal

Update the [`SubscriptionType`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a56a94813b677713d9f8c43e320ca06cd3314c3f/app/graphql/types/subscription_type.rb) to have the attributes `enable_renew_from: Date` and `can_add_seats: Boolean` in the response.

- `enableRenewFrom` should have the same behaviour as [the method on `Subscription`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a56a94813b677713d9f8c43e320ca06cd3314c3f/app/models/subscription.rb#L684)
- `canAddSeats` should be `false` for community program subscriptions (and `true` for all others?)

More discussion in planning issue here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363537

### Result

These attributes are available on the `SubscriptionType` in the CustomersDot GraphQL API.",3
110195583,2022-06-15 21:16:28.510,More customizations when creating marketplace subscriptions,"### Background

We found out in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6873#note_993065034) that more customizations are needed when creating accounts and subscriptions in the Marketplace API in CDot.

### Proposal

The following 3 customizations are needed.  As I understand it, these fields will be static for all Marketplace orders.

#### 1. `IsInvoiceSeparate = TRUE`

All Arrow subscriptions should be invoiced separately (e.g. `IsInvoiceSeparate` = `true`). The default setting for `IsInvoiceSeparate` = `false` for subscriptions. However, in order to ensure that we have a 1:1 relationship between subscription and invoice, we will need this setting set to `true`.  

The `IsInvoiceSeparate` attribute can be passed in the subscribe request body as seen in [the Zuora docs](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTsubscribe).  This will be set in the request body where `request_body['subscribes'][0]['SubscriptionData]['Subscription']['IsInvoiceSeparate']` is `TRUE` .

#### 2. `SSPChannel__c = ""Reseller""`

SSP Channel should be set as `Reseller` for the Arrow account in Zuora as well as all end user accounts.  This means setting `SSPChannel__c` to ""Reseller"" for accounts created in the subscribe request.

This field has not be set in the `SubscribeService` before and may require a change to the IronBank schema.

#### 3. `Entity__c`

> Entity MUST be the same on all end user and Arrow account (if Arrow is US end user must be US) - this is a revenue requirement

We don't currently set `Entity__c` when creating accounts as part of the subscribe request so this will be a new attribute to set in the request.  As per [this comment](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6873#note_993248300), this attribute should be set to `""US""` for all Arrow orders.  ~~It's not clear yet whether this applies to all Marketplace orders or just Arrow.  We've [asked about this below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4430#note_995757617), as it may impact where the default lives; a) in Platypus, then passed to CDot in the marketplace request, OR 2) in CDot for all marketplace orders.~~

~~**Update**: per [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4430#note_995956944), we hope to have the `Entity__c` value passed through the Marketplace API request from Platypus.~~

**Update again**: per [comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4430#note_1000132233), we will set `Entity__c = ""US""` for all Marketplace orders in this iteration.",2

110185078,2022-06-15 17:00:36.123,CI min subscriptions have subscription management buttons on CustomersDot,"# Bug

## Summary

Subscriptions that have CI minutes only are not renewable nor upgradable but the `Upgrade plan`, `Resume subscription`, `Buy more CI minutes`, `Buy more storage` buttons are visible on the active CI minutes subscriptions in CustomersDot. The expired ones do not have the `Resume subscription` button.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should not have any subscription management buttons

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

An example of an account that has both expired and active CI minutes subscription is [210330 (internal)](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/210330/)

### Problem
In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4250+, we [decided](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4250#note_945133329) that we would be taking the [one button approach](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4250#-one-button-ob) i.e. hide the internal iframe button and always shown an external button. This is currently behind the feature flag `zuora_hpm_no_refresh`. To achieve this, along with enabling the feature flag, we will also be disabling the internal iframe submit button through Zuora CSS.


### Proposal
1. Update the existing CSS (we can probably get the existing CSS from finance team or check if we have it tracked in our repo) to hide the zuora inline submit button. (Add `display: none` on class `.btn-submit.btn-submit` and remove existing CSS on `.btn-submit.btn-submit`)
2. Add the Zuora HPM id (both staging and production) and the new CSS to be updated in this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/791) description.
3. If this CSS is not being tracked in the repo currently, consider adding it with the appropriate naming convention (e.g. the id from [secrets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/config/secrets.yml.example#L91)).   

_Note: We currently have 2 css files ([style.css](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/vendor/zuora/css/style.css) and [hpm2.css](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/vendor/zuora/css/hpm2.css)) being tracked in our repo. Need to confirm which HPM these styles are for. Updating the CSS file names with a clearer naming convention might help in identifying the correct HPM going ahead._

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
We need to update the Zuora HPM id (staging and production) and the updated CSS to hide inline submit button in Zuora iframe in this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/791) description.  
We need to mention in this issue that we need to finalise on a date and time so as to sync the Zuora CSS update and enabling the feature flag `zuora_hpm_no_refresh`. Read this [discussion](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7969#note_992473878) for more context on why this is needed.

This is currently behind the feature flag `zuora_hpm_no_refresh`. To achieve this, along with enabling the feature flag, we will also be disabling the internal iframe submit button through Zuora CSS.

However we would have a problem in syncing the two operations - enabling the `zuora_no_hpm_refresh` feature flag and the zuora css update (since the CSS update will be done by finance systems team through an issue). If we enable `zuora_no_hpm_refresh` and then update the Zuora CSS, we will see 2 buttons for the time duration we take between the 2 updates. If we update Zuora CSS first and then the feature flag, then we will see no buttons in the time duration we take between the 2 updates. This will only affect the `Add new payment method` functionality since currently that is the only implementation where we are using the internal iframe button.  

### Proposal
1. Introduce a feature flag `add_new_payment_method_maintenance_mode`.  
2. Make code changes to show `Maintenance mode` message when feature flag is enabled and not to allow users to use the `Add new payment` page.

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
`Maintenance mode` message should be shown when `add_new_payment_method_maintenance_mode` feature flag is enabled.

110138452,2022-06-15 07:19:01.878,Refactor customer registration emoji validation,"We recently introduced validation against emojis on the ~frontend. During the implementation of , we realised it would've been less tedious work to already abstract the validation logic (gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com!5006), in order to reduce the amount of later refactoring. We later introduced [`VeeValidate`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5017/diffs) to do the heavy lifting for custom form validation.

### Problem

When a user purchases a new subscription, it includes the product and the number of quantity they wish to subscribe to.

In the Subscribe API, this information was captured in [rate_plan_data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L154) attribute. It included details of the main and optional plan.

We need a way to capture this information when creating a new subscription through the Orders API.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

The [Order action `createSubscription`](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order) has a `subscribeToRatePlans` object. It holds the list of rate plans associated with the subscription.

Use the object to pass the rate plans a user subscribes to.

### Result

The selected plan and quantity gets reflects in the new order / subscription created.

109863886,2022-06-09 15:20:36.963,Handle true ups for community program subscriptions,"### Problem

GitLab does not prevent customers from exceeding their seat count. For paying customers with legacy licenses (community programs also uses legacy licenses), we ask them to pay for overages when they renew for the next year, a process called true-ups. However, since community programs licenses are free, there's really no need to ask them to pay for or report any overages, since any true-ups charges would be for $0 anyway.

### Proposal

Since the licenses for customers who are on 14.0 or earlier will error when they try to add them to the instance for missing true-up quantity, we should add a `very large number` of true-ups to every license for community program subscriptions so it works for both.

We should make sure this works for customers irrespective of the version they are on.

[Error message that should happen without the fix for testing purposes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4397#note_991043970)

> After a subscription is renewed then a new license is generated for the SM customer. The renewed license contains information like new user quantity being renewed, starts_at, expires_at etc. It also contains the trueup_quantity information. The trueup_quantity is then pulled from the renewed license within the SM instance and verified with the last year's extra active user count. If the trueup quantity is less than the last year's users difference then an error is displayed on the SM instance.

109861516,2022-06-09 14:41:35.945,Ramp ID from Zuora GET Subscription API,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4303, we implemented a solution to get Ramp ID for a subscription using the https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_RampsBySubscriptionKey Zuora API endpoint.  This was necessary because Ramp ID was not available through the existing Zuora API endpoint that CustomersDot uses to get other Subscription data, https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETSubscription.  

Using https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_RampsBySubscriptionKey works as a short-term solution, but isn't ideal because it requires an additional Zuora request to fetch Ramp ID.

### Proposal

Zuora has agreed to adding Ramp ID to the https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETSubscription API soon (potentially in late June).  When it becomes available, we can remove some of the logic introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4303, including the extra request to https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_RampsBySubscriptionKey.",2

109812181,2022-06-08 22:25:12.826,Number of users field should default to empty in purchase flow,"# Feature Proposal

## Problem to solve

The number of users field in the new purchase flow defaults to `1`. [This has caused users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/community-operations/community-operations/-/issues/155#note_976584791) to accidentally purchase subscriptions for 1 user, because they do not change the default.

![Screen_Shot_2022-06-08_at_5.12.27_PM](/uploads/4e4006d335a098292345d7a93b0acefb/Screen_Shot_2022-06-08_at_5.12.27_PM.png)

### Flows affected

* New self-managed standard subscription purchase
* New self-managed community program subscription purchase

## Proposal

For the new subscription purchase flow and community programs new subscription flow, the default for the number of users field should be empty (and it should be a required field for the customer to purchase a subscription). This will force the customer to proactively enter a number instead of passively accepting our default of `1`.",3
109724546,2022-06-07 15:19:52.457,[Feature flag] Enable Zuora Ramp Deals,"# Summary

This issue is to rollout [Zuora Ramp Deals](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7099) on CustomersDot production,
that is currently behind the [`zuora_ramp_deals`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/137/edit) feature flag.

This feature flag should gate the logic for provisioning ramped subscriptions as described in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7192+, but may also gate logic for the display of ramped subscriptions in CustomersDot as well.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::fulfillment platform"" 
- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_provision`
- Best individual to reach out to: @cwiesner 
- PM: @courtmeddaugh 

## Stakeholders

`@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team

## The Rollout Plan

- Partial Rollout with specific Customers on CustomersDot, [via Unleash](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#user-ids)
- Rollout on CustomersDot for a certain period (How long)
- Percentage Rollout on CustomersDot
- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can also be useful to review -->

## Testing User/Customer IDs

<!--
List any Customer IDs for Customers that are happy to have this feature turned on early.

Remove if not applicable
-->

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

We expect that ramped subscriptions created or updated via sales-assisted deals to be provisioned automatically via CustomersDot.  This could be expanded to include display of ramped subscriptions in CDot in the future (TBD).

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

<!-- Should the feature flag be turned off? Any MRs that need to be rolled back? Communication that needs to happen? What are some things you can think of that could go wrong - data loss or broken pages? -->

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

Errors can be monitored at https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/ .

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7099) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] ~Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)~
- [ ] ~If applicable, [incrementally roll out]~(https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] ~Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.~
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [ ] ~Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7099) that the feature has been globally enabled.~
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/137/edit)",1
109716503,2022-06-07 13:33:11.454,Default active users to current billable member count at renewal,"# Bug

## Summary

The input field for number of users during renewal process for community program SaaS subscriptions should default to current billable members count. 

## Steps to reproduce

Create a SaaS Community Program subscription due for renewal. Add more billable users to the group associated with the subscription so the original purchase quantity is less than the current billable members count.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

The input field for number of users on renewal screen defaults to the number of seats in the previous year's subscription.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

It should be defaulted to current billable member count.

### Problem

Create a service that returns custom attributes required while creating a subscription. It will be used in [`OrderManagerService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4314) when creating a new subscription using Order's API.

It represents the `orderLineItems[:customFields]` param in [Orders API](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order).

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create a service: `Zuora::Orders::CustomFields::CreateSubscription` that implements `#execute` method. It should return a has of custom attributes required when [creating a new subscription](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/6de4998feb23012df7cb7ee8a83874a7aaf49dfa/app/services/subscribe_service.rb#L276).

Subject: [GitLab Transactions] Managing users in your subscription
Body:
Dear <User Name>,

Thank you for purchasing a GitLab.com subscription! As you get started, we want to make sure you understand some important billing information.

Your subscription cost is based on the maximum number of users enabled during the billing period. If you reach the maximum number of users in your subscription, you can continue to add users and GitLab bills you for the overage. These bills occur every quarter.

For more information about quarterly reconciliation, see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html

If you have any questions about this process, please contact https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293. We are happy to assist.

Thank you again for your purchase!

Arrowsphere would like to know when an order has been successfully provisioned.  It was decided that CustomersDot could sent an order status request to Platypus after an Arrowsphere order has been ""provisioned"".  The Platypus order status endpoint is being built in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/integrations/platypus/-/issues/226.  For MVC, ""provisioned"" simply means the license or activation code email has been sent from CustomersDot.

### Proposal

Send the order status request to Platypus after a successful delivery of the license or activation code email as part of processing the subscription/order Zuora callout.  This could be added [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/f730068274d6d4a60615571539243c0c32bef935/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L63) in the `ZuoraCallbackWorker` if the result was successful.

    > **Thought (non-blocking):** This approach totally works, but it's unfortunate that ActiveAdmin doesn't allow it to be more extensible without duplicating so much code. I'm curious if we could avoid the duplication if we used a virtual attribute and extract some of the custom logic into the model.  We've done similar things for Customer admin before ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/c51a1cff53972ad740ac8cbb021188efd109f0ab/app/models/customer.rb#L75)).

I frequently seen the `rspec-zuora` job fail because of one test failure in `spec/features/subscriptions/community_program_renew_purchase_spec.rb`.  Typically, the job passes on retry, but it's an inconvenience, especially when it requires a merge train retry by a maintainer.  It also wastes pipeline resources and ultimately increases costs.  For reference, this spec was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4633+.

I went through a few pages of [pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/pipelines) and quickly found a number of failures because of this spec.

# Bug

## Summary

Many of the team members who use the admin part of CustomersDot are having difficulty using the new UI.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Take a screenshot and change it to black and white.
1. Or, check the colour contrast of the colours.

Example:

![image](/uploads/209a7ca4dca6be72f1f1967af54c0443/image.png)

The inactive menu items are 2.63:1 colour contrast ratio.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

It's difficult to read the text. Even more so for someone who is partially or fully colour blind.

It also goes against our guidelines, and legislation in most countries.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Colours should follow Pajamas: https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/color

including the colour contrast guideline: https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/color#accessibility",1

### Proposal

Let's check back about a month after the rake task mentioned above was run, so around 2023-03-10, to see if there are any new occurrences of BillingAccounts without `salesforce_account_id`.  We could also run the rake task again to see if any of the 70 accounts could now be updated.

If there are new occurrences, we might have a larger issue that needs to be addressed.",1

123621482,2023-02-13 21:53:08.318,Allow Prometheus collection of maintenance events,"### Proposal

This is the first issue listed in [this issue breakdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5582#issue-breakdown).

[Our custom Prometheus Collector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/main/lib/metrics/collector.rb) allows us to collect metrics related to duration of execution of requests (web and api) and Sidekiq jobs, which ultimately leads to the definition of error budgets for the Fulfillment team.

In order to create a new metric that would send amount of time CustomersDot was in maintenance mode:
1. [ ] [the `Metrics::Prometheus::EmitsMetrics` module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/main/lib/metrics/prometheus/emits_metrics.rb) needs to be included in the HealthCheck cron jobs ([here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/main/app/jobs/health_check_cron/check_gitlab_job.rb) and [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/main/app/jobs/health_check_cron/check_zuora_job.rb)) and [the maintenance rake task](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/main/lib/tasks/maintenance_mode.rake). Related methods such as `prometheus_collector` and `thread_data` will need to be implemented and tailored to jobs and the rake task.
2. [ ] we need to build upon the existing current Collector framework to create a new metric label.
3. [ ] finally, we'll have to capture maintenance events in the rake task and cron jobs.

### Architecture

```mermaid

    J[Health cron job in\nSidekiq process 1] --> I[Redis\ngitlab_maintenance_mode: 0 or 1\nzuora_maintenance_mode: 0 or 1\ncustomersdot_maintenance_mode: 0 or 1]

### Result

The `/metrics` endpoint should serve labels and metrics related to the existing types of CustomersDot maintenance (Gitlab, Zuora or manual).

### Next steps (if any)

123620988,2023-02-13 21:40:30.447,Link to CDot from Version App should use BillingAccount instead of Customer,"### Problem

The [version.gitlab.com application](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com) links to a Customer show page in CDot Admin from its Hosts index page.  [This is where the link is generated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/app/helpers/current_host_stats_helper.rb#L69) in the Version App.  There is a [secret configured](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/config/secrets.yml#L15) for `customers_admin_url` that uses the value `http://localhost:5000/admin/customer`.

With the change to using the new BillingAccount data structure, the real `salesforce_account_id` column exists on BillingAccount.  This column still exists on `Customer` but should no longer be used and will be removed in the future.

Note: The link from VersionApp to CDot works because the customer URL uses the `salesforce_account_id` (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/admin/customer/00164000010c3XFABY`).  This lookup works in RailsAdmin because of [this code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/4ae39fa629f11d88d5575837412df990e624b9a5/config/initializers/rails_admin.rb#L160) in the initializer.

**UPDATE:** We [realized a problem with the original solution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6527#note_1278726123). If there are multiple Customers (and now BillingAccounts) with the same `salesforce_account_id`, this lookup logic picks the first record which could be misleading for Admins linking from VersionApp.

### Proposal

The link in VersionApp should be updated to direct Admins to the BillingAccount instead of a Customer.  Also, the link should go to the BillingAccount list page with the salesforce_account_id prefilled in the search to avoid any confusion mentioned above.

There are a couple of changes that are necessary to make this happen.

1. [x] Update version-gitlab-com app code to point to the BillingAccount search page (e.g. `https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin/billing_account?&model_name=billing_account&query=0017400000DGjddAAD`).  This will require an update to [the secrets file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/config/secrets.yml#L15).  For production, this may need to be updated via a secrets vault.
   - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-services/version-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/726
1. [x] The RailsAdmin initializer overrides the lookup adapter to allow `salesforce_account_id` to be used as id.  This override logic will no longer be necessary when the change to Version App above is merged/deployed.

123620091,2023-02-13 21:27:11.138,Create new model to track maintenance mode events,"### Proposal

This is the first issue listed in [this issue breakdown](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5582#issue-breakdown).

We need to record information related to events when CustomersDot enters and leaves maintenance mode.

Even though such information will be sent to Prometheus as a metric (more infor in [related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5582)) and therefore we don't need long-term persistence, we still need to be able to record the event (maintenance) start time. This cannot be achieved through Rails caching or through some sort of global variable as a Puma restart might happen during a maintenance.

This issue tracks efforts towards the creation of such model.

### Result

A very small table with one row per type of maintenance:
- maintenance triggered because GitLab is not reachable
- maintenance triggered because Zuora is not reachable
- maintenance mode triggered manually (through the `customers:maintenance_mode` rake task)

As noted in [the feature flag rollout issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867), the `account_data_structure` feature flag has been enabled in all environments.  It was [enabled in Production on Monday, 2023-02-06](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867#note_1267484731).  We haven't noticed any major issues so far that have required disabling the feature flag and we will continue to monitor it.

### Proposal

If after a week (anytime after 2023-02-13), the feature flag is still stable, we should feel comfortable promoting the `account_data_structure` feature flag and removing the legacy code and conditions from the application code.

While removing the feature flag checks, we may encounter opportunities to refactor and simplifying existing logic.",5

We need to make sure that the `BillingAccount#salesforce_account_id` is always set to the Zuora account `crm_id`.

It is OK to have blank `salesforce_account_ids` as long as the values for these in Zuora are also blank. [Reference - external](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C037WQ2BUGK/p1675884549880319?thread_ts=1675801765.250799&cid=C037WQ2BUGK)

> There are some valid use cases where a Zuora Billing Account does not have an SFDC CRM ID - when we switch entity, we want to use the new Billing Account, the Account is in Zuora for non-sales reasons (such as marketing), etc.

We currently have occurrences of `BillingAccount#salesforce_account_id` [being blank on our end and not in Zuora](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/billing_account/1284). This looks like an old billing account that might have been created before the `UpdateBillingAccountService` was [updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6078/diffs) to set the `salesforce_account_id` attribute.

Currently CDot Admins have no visibility into the Bill To or Sold To Contacts associated with a Billing Account.  This must be managed directly in the Zuora UI.  It would be beneficial to the Support team to have management capabilities within the CDot Admin interface.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6453+, a shared example is moved from the `ReconciliationService` specs into a new file. During the review, it was discovered that the shared example isn't used anymore. Its usage was removed as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6254+ where the feature flag `use_orders_api_to_preview_quoted_invoice_amount` was cleaned up. The shared example includes some test coverage for examples that aren't covered outside of the shared example (e.g. [this spec's context](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f51240cf801b31a9aebb1742ff26fda446a5db82/spec/support/shared_examples/services/reconciliation_service.rb#L343-352)).

### Proposal

Go through the shared example and determine which specs still need to be used to have better test coverage. Use the shared example in the `ReconciliationService` specs if some are needed and remove any that aren't needed anymore.

Better test coverage if some examples are needed. Otherwise some removed code.",2
122969631,2023-02-02 22:33:24.801,Spike: Create proposal for caching mechanism for BillingAccount  Contacts,"### Problem

We know that Zuora Account Contacts are used frequently in CustomersDot, most importantly the Sold To Contact.  The Sold To Contact is the person who receives licenses or activations codes, or other notifications from CDot.  The Sold To Contact information is also used to find or create CDot Customer record when processing Subscription/Order related callouts from Zuora.

### Proposal

Given their importance, we could consider creating a model for BillingAccount Contacts and caching this data from Zuora in CDot.  This could function similarly to what we've built for `BillingAccount` in that we persist just the data needed for CDot.  

To keep the data in CDot in sync with Zuora, a custom event with its own callout could be created for Contacts.  A [similar custom event and callout mechanism was created for BillingAccounts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1ba32625852d05582e328e3b2f46e4df7e335d2f/doc/zuora/zuora_callouts.md#L168) and would serve as a model for this new purpose.  The syncing mechanism for Bill To and Sold To will differ a bit from Billing Account because the bill_to_id and sold_to_id live on the billing_account which we want to keep in sync, but also the contact data itself.

#### Considerations

- Consider whether to cache all Zuora contact information in CDot or just the Bill To and Sold To.  I suspect it will be the latter but worth debate.  
- Contact information is currently help on the `Customer` model for paid customers at the moment.  If we introduce a contact model in CDot, these contact fields on Customer should not be used once the Customer converts to a paid Customer (e.g. has a `BillingAccountMembership`).

### Result

The outcome of this issue should be a proposal for caching billing account contacts in CDot.  Ideally this could be an issue, or set of issues if the work is large enough.  This proposal could be added to the overall [proposal documentation for Bill To / Sold To Contact management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/contacts_management_proposal.md).",3
122951725,2023-02-02 15:32:10.008,Your company details form should not trigger syncing Zuora Contacts,"### Problem

We discovered while working on user workflow documentation for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6226 an unexpected behavior of the `Your company details` form for logged in customers.  You can find more details in [the original thread here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6226#note_1261379713).

> Those 2 forms are separate (e.g. they only submit the params for their own section) despite being submitted to the same API endpoint (PATCH `/customers`), and trigger the same service to update Zuora contacts and accounts.
>
> It looks like that [service won't update the Zuora Account if neither of the 2 attributes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9aa9f695d0df918de5ad3697ba4f6321d8258eef/app/services/update_contact_service.rb#L66) (name, vat_id) have changed. However, that same service also [updates the Zuora Contacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9aa9f695d0df918de5ad3697ba4f6321d8258eef/app/services/update_contact_service.rb#L76) and this appears to run regardless of if anything changed, so it will always sync those when called. This means, even when the account section, `Your company details`, is submitted, the contacts are still synced.

![Screenshot_2023-02-02_at_10.21.23_AM](/uploads/2c564550da8fa5f06a5c52476a513cad/Screenshot_2023-02-02_at_10.21.23_AM.png)

### Proposal

The `Your company details` form should only update the Customer company and BillingAccount data in CDot, while syncing to Zuora Account.  Contact data should not be synced with Zuora Contacts as this information should not be changed.  It's an unnecessary syncing step.

The service responsible for the sync with Zuora is [the `UpdateContactService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/9aa9f695d0df918de5ad3697ba4f6321d8258eef/app/services/update_contact_service.rb#L7).  This service is triggered from the Customer model [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/80b89944453495fbb3ed3f42b105ba91ed2570a9/app/models/customer.rb#L70) in an `after_validation` callback.  We could explore ways to avoid this callback behavior altogether, as it's not ideal, but also rearchitect this service in general.  Here are some ideas:

- Split out the `UpdateContactService` into multiple jobs?  One for Account and another for Contact.  This would allow us to trigger the one that is appropriate based on attributes changed by the form.
- Perform the sync to Zuora in a background job (or jobs) instead so that it doesn't hinder performance, and we'd also benefit from the sidekiq retry mechanism.

It might be easier to wait until https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950+ is live so that we can fully rely on the new account data structure for this re-architecture.",5

### Problem
Duplicate `RatePlanCharges` are created in Zuora when we add different products to a ramp subscription. Since we use `RatePlanCharges` to show ramps in the subscription card design for ramp subscriptions, duplicate rows will be shown to the customer if we show these `RatePlanCharges` without filtering.  

**Currently implemented solution:** Filter out `RatePlanCharges` with `$0 TCV`. 

**Problem with current solution:** The check to filter out `$0 TCV` `RatePlanCharges` feels a bit flimsy and could lead to filtering out of valid `RatePlanCharges` if we do have products in ramp subscriptions in the future which are sold at $0.  
Details in this [thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5654#note_1264773352).

### Updated Proposal
For %""15.10"" as per this suggestion from `@tgolubeva`, we could filter out the duplicate `RatePlanCharges` based on the condition that `EffectiveEndDate` is same as `EffectiveStartDate`.

### Problem

Once we have completed the work in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5204, all the notifications covered in the [`LicenseNotificationService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/license_notification_service.rb) will have a voucher email sent to the SFDC address and a background copy sent to the resellers.

This service currently reports `Invoice for reseller not found` when the subscription does not have an invoice at the time of the notification. However, this not uncommon as reseller managed subscriptions can be billed after provisioning. 

As a result we get a few errors reported each day (see [this example](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=%22RuntimeError:%20Invoice%20for%20reseller%20not%20found%22%0Aseverity%3DERROR;timeRange=P1D;cursorTimestamp=2023-02-01T17:13:40.615Z?project=gitlab-subscriptions-prod) at the time of writing) which get reported by the [`ZuoraCallbackWorker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/2fa4bfb8cb2e472d08a546d271002a433589cdb4/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L69) too ([example](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=%22Error%20sending%20license%20notification%22%0Aseverity%3DERROR;timeRange=P1D;cursorTimestamp=2023-02-01T17:13:40.619Z?project=gitlab-subscriptions-prod)). This generates a lot of noise to our logs.  


### Proposal

Since the [`ResellerNotificationService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/services/reseller_notification_service.rb) only usage is happening in the `LicenseNotificationService` and it's mostly being noisy at this point, we could remove the service and its usage from the codebase once we validate that resellers are getting the expected vouchers.

122846452,2023-02-01 13:56:52.537,Reuse confirmation email after CDot admin update,"## Problem

There are currently no guardrails in place when changing the email of a CDot account through the [CDot admin panel](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin).

This is a risk because human error can occur, and an incorrect email can be used for a CDot account. This could lead to the wrong person gaining access to another CDot account and receiving all of its email notifications containing sensitive information (anything related to subscriptions).

FYI: Related [RCA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/1026)

## Proposal

We reuse the [confirmation email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/vs%2Fupgrade-rails-admin/app/views/customers/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb) that is sent when a CDot account email address is changed. The same email should be sent to customers when a CDot email address is updated via the [admin panel](https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/admin).

Additionally, we reuse the email to [inform the old email address owner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/views/devise/mailer/email_changed.text.erb) about the change.

## Result

Affected CDot customers are notified of the email change and must confirm the new email address to access their CDot account. Even if the wrong email is used, the affected CDot customer will be notified.",2
122577963,2023-01-27 16:55:34.457,Add sales team as stakeholder for review,"### Problem

The [Sales Systems team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/) is responsible for sales systems, notably [Salesforce](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/6b2e3dd5f4ebcfd8f295cc46b1e8474093f276ea/doc/salesforce/README.md) at GitLab.  Salesforce is a business critical Order-to-Cash system that is linked with CustomersDot.  SFDC Lead, oportunity, account creation and more can be triggered from CDot.  Changes to SFDC are synced to Zuora, which then makes it way to CDot by way of callouts.

Given this important interactivity between systems, we need to make sure changes to CDot don't break this interaction and cause outages or data loss.  To prevent outages, Fulfillment engineers should request a review from a Sales system team member if an MR contains changes that impact Salesforce.  

Currently, we have a checklist item in [our default MR template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md#conformity) to remind engineers to request a review.  It can be easy to miss this checklist item and forget to request the review.

### Proposal

It looks like Danger was improved as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/738+ to make suggestions for sales systems reviewers if the MR contains the `Affects Salesforce` label.

The [Enterprise Applications team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/) is responsible for all of GitLab's finance systems and Enterprise Applications integrations.  The most important of these systems is Zuora.  In Fulfillment, we work with Zuora Billing quite often as it is a [critical Order-2-Cash system](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/83a95b12efd44ce00ea03d26e3c953a310d8228f/doc/architecture/data_architecture.md#L10).

CustomersDot directly interacts with Zuora Billing in many ways like Subscription creation and Billing Account management.  Changes in CustomersDot around Zuora Billing logic could impact this integration, leading to downtime or data loss. To prevent this, Fulfillment engineers should request a review from a Enterprise Apps member (Zuora architect) if an MR contains changes to Zuora-related logic.  It's easy to forget to request a review, even with [a checklist item to the MR template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md#conformity).

### Proposal

Detecting which changes are Zuora-related is the key detail for this issue.  It might be something as simple as looking for files that include the word ""zuora"" but the might be too aggressive.  We could consider specific files or directories as well (`lib/zuora`, `app/services/zuora`, `app/workers/zuora*`, etc).",2

Some database migrations in CustomersDot could impact this pipeline, leading to downtime. To prevent outages, Fulfillment engineers should request a review from a Data team member if an MR contains database changes.  It's easy to forget to request a review, even if we add a checklist item to the MR template.

### Proposal

Let's update Danger in CDot to prompt MR authors to request reviews from the Data team when the MR contains database changes.

122497658,2023-01-26 16:04:20.834,[Spike] GitLab Dedicated Automated Provisioning Scoping,"## Background
~""group::provision"" is planning to automate the provisioning of GitLab Dedicated, which today is a fully manual process done with legacy licenses created by the Support team.

Details about current process & LOE estimate can be found here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/754

## Outcome of this Issue 
Review and breakdown the work needed to successfully setup provisioning for GitLab Dedicated. Specifically, we should:
* Receive the Zuora callout for all Dedicated products
* Generate an activation code for the correct seat count
* Display correct product details in Customers Dot

## Result: Issues Created
1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6148+ - this issue should be able to address the MVC for provisioning of GitLab Dedicated, including generation of an activation code

Follow-ups:
1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6269+ - this will allow custom Dedicated-specific content for customers
1. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6270+ - this will ensure we track GitLab Dedicated provisioning accurately as part of the ~""Provision Tracking System""

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/782+ defines the process for customers to activate with Cloud Licensing mid-term if they already have an active legacy license subscription. Previously, for most customers, a Support ticket was required to move to Cloud Licensing. With the changes made to backfill `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `null`, plus the work done in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5602 to begin creating codes for all SM subscriptions (even `TurnOnCloudLicensing` = `No`), we have significantly increased availability for customers to self-activate with Cloud Licensing.

The last step for all customers to be able to self-activate will be this issue, that will backfill all remaining subscriptions missing an activation code.


## Proposal
Backfill any active SM subscriptions missing an activation code.

We can reuse [the code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1ba32625852d05582e328e3b2f46e4df7e335d2f/lib/tasks/data_maintenance/pre_strict_cloud_license/backfill_cloud_activations.rake) introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4892 and make some modifications to support the different context.

### Problem

We use the `subscription#update` API to add new seats to an existing subscription. In this issue, we create a GraphQL mutation to perform this operation.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

- Create a mutation namespace `subscriptions` in `app/graphql/mutations` if it does not already exist
- Create a mutation class `AddSeats` in the namespace

#### Step 1: Define the following arguments:

|Argument|Type|Required?|
|---|---|---|
|`subscription_number`|`GraphQL::Types::String`|Yes|
|`quantity`|`GraphQL::Types::Int`|Yes|
|`payment_method_id`|`GraphQL::Types::String`|No (`payment_method_id` is not included during preview) |
|`preview`|`GraphQL::Types::Boolean`|No (defaults to `false`)|

#### Step 2: Tweaks to Order related services

- [Define new custom action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/90561f906dfcf42afd25a086d5ea68bd183a733f/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/mapping.rb#L7): `add_seats`. Map the action to `UpdateProduct`. We currently [combine](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/90561f906dfcf42afd25a086d5ea68bd183a733f/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_generator.rb#L95) adding of seats independently with adding of seats during renewal, reconciliation. This will give us an opportunity to decouple the logic [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/90561f906dfcf42afd25a086d5ea68bd183a733f/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/update_product.rb#L34).
- Define the new custom action `add_seats` in `ParamConstructor::UpdateProduct`. 
  - Set `product` to `main_product`
  - `quantity` to `new_quantity` + existing quantity of `main_product`
  - `contract_effective_date` as current date

#### Step 3: Define `resolve` method:

- Perform [seat max validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/90561f906dfcf42afd25a086d5ea68bd183a733f/app/services/zuora/orders/amendment/action_types_validator.rb#L61)

    Zuora::Orders::OrderManagerService.new(customer: customer, order_action_types: action_types, params: params, subscription: subscription)
  ```

  - `action_types` = `add_seats`
  - `params` should contain `id` (subscription number), `quantity`, `payment_method_id`. May contain `preview`

### Result

The mutation should add the seats specified to the main product of the subscription.

122336417,2023-01-24 04:47:03.913,Add Sync Billing Account action to Admin,"### Problem

When enabling the new CustomersDot Billing Account architecture we need to make sure we continue to support all the actions used to manage Customer associations with Zuora Billing Accounts via the Admin.

We will document the updated procedures via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5434+

Updating the `salesforce_account_id` related to a CustomersDot Billing Account is not possible ATM given we don't allow the editing of `BillingAccount` records via the Admin.

We don't want to allow setting **any** value for the `salesforce_account_id` value at this given we want to keep Zuora as the SSoT for it via the `crm_id` in the Zuora Billing Account.

We want to implement a Sync action for a CDot Billing Account via the Admin that will allow us to refresh its `name` and `salesforce_account_id` to those in Zuora.

:heavy_plus_sign: See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5434#note_1248078612 for more context.

### Proposal

Implement the ""Sync Billing Account"" action via CustomersDot Admin.

One click action with confirmation on successful sync.

### Acceptance criteria

A CustomersDot Billing Account can be synced with Zuora via the CDot Admin.

We will document the updated procedures via https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5434+

Associating a CustomersDot user to a Zuora Billing Account that is not represented via a CustomersDot Billing Account is not possible ATM given we don't allow the creation of `BillingAccount` records via the Admin (just `BillingAccountMembership`s)

:heavy_plus_sign: See: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5434#note_1248078612 for more context.

### Proposal

Implement the ""Create Billing Account"" action via CustomersDot Admin.

Inputs for the new form: `zuora_account_id`

When the user enters a `zuora_account_id` and submits the `new` form:
- If the id is already associated to a CDot account display the error in the form.
- If the id is not associated to a CDot account:
  - Fetch the Zuora Billing Account for the provided id
  - Create the CDot Billing Account using the info in the Zuora one for the other fields: name, salesforce_account_id.

### Result

A CustomersDot user can be added as a member to any existing Zuora Billing Account.

### Acceptance criteria
- When a Zuora Billing Account is represented in CDot via a Billing Account we can add a membership for an existing customer via the Admin.
- When a Zuora Billing Account is not represented in CDot via a Billing Account we can create a CDot Billing Account for it **and** add a membership for an existing customer via the Admin.",3
122207891,2023-01-20 18:38:59.242,Backfill tasks should reference zuora_account_id column instead of overwritten method,"### Problem

As described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4867#note_1247871087, we found after enabling the `account_data_structure` feature flag that the backfill rake task `lib/tasks/data_maintenance/billing_accounts/backfill_with_customers.rake` no longer works.  This is because the rake task uses `customer.zuora_account_id` which is an overwritten [attr reader method on Customer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/aa5aec8253fdad5cb4b846a6d778739fd37affcc/app/models/customer.rb#L162).  When the flag is enabled, this method pulls the `zuora_account_id` from the `BillingAccountMembership` instead of directly from the Customer column.

### Proposal

Update the rake task to use the `zuora_account_id` directly on the Customer record (e.g. `customer[:zuora_account_id]`) instead of the reader method on Customer.

### Result

The rake task continues to work even after the feature flag is enabled.",1
122063515,2023-01-18 16:38:38.666,New account purchase creates separate Bill and Sold To Contacts,"### Problem

We noticed while troubleshooting https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5449+ that when purchasing a subscription with a new Customer (e.g. no associated Zuora Account), the Order API actually creates separate Bill To and Sold To Contacts that have identical information.  I believe this is a change in behavior from the existing Subscribe API.

This is an example of a Zuora Account created while making a new account purchase in my local CDot: https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomerAccount.do?method=view&id=8ad08d2985c4e1580185c5a8bebf51a9.  Notice this the separate contact records that have the same information.

### Proposal

I've found that the Orders API requires [an additional parameter](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Order/#!path=newAccount/soldToSameAsBillTo&t=request), `soldToSameAsBillTo`, to instruct Zuora to create the Account with the same Contact record for Bill to and Sold to.  I've already tested this by adding this param and [the resulting account](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomerAccount.do?method=view&id=8ad0889d85c4e1560185c5afc1b52cbe) was created with the same Contact for both Bill to and Sold to as expected.",1
122054951,2023-01-18 15:42:42.067,Skip license notification for non-ramp subscriptions if no new license is required,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5242+, notifications are skipped if nothing has changed in the new ramp interval. For Multi-Year subscriptions that are non-ramp, the same should apply as discussed [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5242#note_1244526220).

### Proposal

Remove the check for the subscription to be ramp enabled ([code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e5a66632e43ba7595e62b644c376b3d5f70ebdcf/app/services/license_notification_service.rb#L92)) as well as [this code comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e5a66632e43ba7595e62b644c376b3d5f70ebdcf/app/services/license_notification_service.rb#L43) to also skip the notification for non-ramp subscriptions.

### Result

Same behaviour for all Multi-Year subscription regardless of being for a ramp or not by skipping the notification if nothing has changed has changed in the new year of the subscription and no new license is required.

# Summary

Spike DRI/s: `@tanuki`

The Provision Error Budget panel seems to not reflect the request health rate computed from the logs. The following example is taken during Seat Link peak period, from 2023/1/19 03:00 UTC to 2023/1/19 05:00 UTC:

At that period, SeatLink requests is only over the latency threshold [46](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:'2023-01-18T03:00:00.000Z',to:'2023-01-18T05:00:00.000Z'))&_a=(columns:!(),filters:!(),index:'7dbddf20-5530-11ed-b0ec-930003e0679c',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:'json.controller%20:%20%22Api::V1::SeatLinksController%22%20and%20json.duration%20%3E%208500'),sort:!(!(json.time,desc)))) out of [5907](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!t,value:0),time:(from:'2023-01-18T03:00:00.000Z',to:'2023-01-18T05:00:00.000Z'))&_a=(columns:!(),filters:!(),index:'7dbddf20-5530-11ed-b0ec-930003e0679c',interval:auto,query:(language:kuery,query:'json.controller%20:%20%22Api::V1::SeatLinksController%22%20'),sort:!(!(json.time,desc)))) times, which should equal to 99% success apdex rate.

121956499,2023-01-17 09:53:57.766,Allow admin resend of cloud activation code even if there is an activated instance present,"### Problem

With the implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4023+, we do not send out the activation code email again after an activated instance is present. This is useful for avoiding to send out the activation code again in case of a renewal or other amendments to the subscription. However, this may have a side effect as this logic also prevents to resend the activation code in the Admin. This wasn't needed so far but after reconsideration it might make sense to provide this ability in the Admin.

### Proposal

Allowing for resendof an activation code in the Admin even if there is an activated instance present for the subscription.

### Result

Ability to resend activation code in the Admin no matter the current state of activation.

# Summary

<!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. -->

This issue is to rollout [Pass long tail description as jtbd when create Workato lead
](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5452) on CustomersDot production,
that is currently behind the [pass_jtbd_longtail_desc_to_workato](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/190/edit) feature flag.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::commerce integration"" 
- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_commerce_integrations`
- Best individual to reach out to: @qzhaogitlab 
- PM: @courtmeddaugh 

## Stakeholders

- @MihaiConteanu 

## The Rollout Plan

- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? Sentry errors reports can also be useful to review -->


## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

Workato lead creation endpoint receives payload `jbtd: <long tail description>` instead of `jbtd: <api reason>`.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

If anything wrong, we can disable the feature flag [pass_jtbd_longtail_desc_to_workato](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/190/edit)

If necessary, it is possible to write a script to update the Workato leads: 
- read lead attributes from CustomersDot Lead table
- call `Workato::CreateLeadService`

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

- No [reporting error](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=logName%3D%2528%22projects%2Fgitlab-subscriptions-prod%2Flogs%2Fsidekiq.production%22%20OR%20%22projects%2Fgitlab-subscriptions-prod%2Flogs%2Frails.production%22%2529%0A%22Workato%22%20AND%20jsonPayload.success%20%3D%20false%0A;timeRange=P2D;cursorTimestamp=2023-01-05T22:31:43.123Z?project=gitlab-subscriptions-prod) related to this change
- Will ask @MihaiConteanu to confirm whether anything is wrong from Workato side. (We do not have access to Workato and downstream systems).

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process) -- Not needed.
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated -- Not needed
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially  `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)). -- Not needed

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:

In `AutoRenew::BasePresenter`, the `zuora_account` is used to [get the default payment method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/b5e4974cf7a33400945369b06d199fa842cc1261/app/presenters/auto_renew/base_presenter.rb#L31).  This is fetched from the given `customer` (e.g. `customer.zuora_account`).  However, it would be more accurate long-term when the `account_data_structure` is in place to pull this from the `order` instead.

### Proposal

Update `AutoRenew::BasePresenter` to get `zuora_account` from the `order` when the `account_data_structure` feature flag is enabled.",2

The EntApps team is conducting end-to-end UAT of Zuora Ramps prior to implementation (expected Feb 1, 2023). This issue will be used to track UAT efforts of ~""group::provision"" in the dev stack only. This will require testing in a local CDot environment. Because of this, more thorough testing will be conducted in Staging by Fulfillment in the related issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5742.

More details on full project testing can be found in the [EntApps related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/1051)

## Test Cases for Dev
The full list of test cases can be found in: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmdJ6ToiCyFNtqjrNPvwcGR7gCvkskjLnZXwAzEMT40/edit#gid=0

For dev testing, we should pick a few line items from this sheet (a few differing scenarios) to ensure the provisioning is working as expected.

## Result
Sign-off from ~""group::provision"" that provisioning appears to be working correctly  and we are comfortable with proceeding with Staging deployment.

We found several unsuccessful Workato lead creations. 
- First one: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5418#note_1222258595. The root cause is unstable network `Net::ReadTimeout` https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5418#note_1222259741

- Fourth one: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5418#note_1225168532

Although there are different reasons for the above 4 unsuccessful cases, they could all succeed with a retry.

ATM, if `Workato::CreateLeadService.new.execute(lead_attrs)` returns `success: false`, `Workato::CreateLeadWorker` does NOT do anything.

We should retry Workato::CreateLeadService failures. (BTW: `Workato::CreateLeadWorker` is safe to retry -- if the lead already exists, Workato will update existing lead.)

120760187,2022-12-21 16:40:05.621,Document new process for managing Customer associations with Zuora Billing Accounts,"### Problem

With the data structure changes introduced in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8950+, team members outside of Fulfillment who routinely use CDot need to be aware of these changes.  In particular, CDot Admins who might manage Zuora Billing Account associations for Customers.

Previously, the Admin page for Customers allowed admins to change the `zuora_account_id` for a Customer as shown below.

![Screen_Shot_2022-12-21_at_11.43.56_AM](/uploads/d749e76bcf80a8079f75d347f3714b00/Screen_Shot_2022-12-21_at_11.43.56_AM.png)

When the new data structure goes live (`account_data_structure` feature flag enabled), this ability will change.  The `zuora_account_id` field on the Customers page will be removed.  Instead, the association to a Zuora Account will be managed through a Billing Account Memberships.  A Billing Account Membership can be created or removed which associates a Customer with a Billing Account record.  The following screenshot shows the new Billing Account Memberships page.

![Screen_Shot_2022-12-21_at_11.46.33_AM](/uploads/45f2b45a830253d8d885369e63a5898c/Screen_Shot_2022-12-21_at_11.46.33_AM.png)

The Billing Account is the record that has the association with a Zuora Account and has the `zuora_account_id` field as shown below.

People include when communicating this documentation:
- Finance systems and Billing team (`@annapiaseczna` for instance)
- Support team

As noted by `@kevenhughes` [below](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5434#note_1234552915), [support workflows documented in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/) will likely need to be updated.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

<!-- Which dashboards from https://dashboards.gitlab.net are most relevant? -->

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Notify the Software Engineers in Test (SETs) for Fulfillment via Slack and in a comment in this issue when enabling a feature flag in `customers-staging` as it can impact the QA pipeline.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Ensure to update Workato URL and credentials in Ansible project.(Needs to receive [credentials](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5010#note_1215740301) first)
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does. -- Checked, not needed.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated -- There is only internal(developer facing documentation). Will update later. The major update would be https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/product_qualified_lead_guide/index.md. It is also mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/vendor_analysis/index.md and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/data_architecture_proposal.md
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [ ] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [x] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [x] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment
- [ ] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",1

### Problem
For ramp subscriptions, we need to show different products (plan, CI minutes, storage) in their own sections as per the [new design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3916/). For this we need an identifier on each product as to what type of product it is.

### Proposal
On the product level we need to add another attribute `sub_type` which will have value `plan`, `storage`, `ci-minutes` based on the kind of product. This will be used on the frontend to show different product section on the new subscription card.  
Also add the `rate_plan_id` which will be used to map each product against the ramps which will be sent in a different key in this issue - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5375.

```
.rubocop.yml: RSpec/TimecopFreeze has the wrong namespace - should be Gitlab/RSpec 
.rubocop.yml: RSpec/TimecopTravel has the wrong namespace - should be Gitlab/RSpec

This code should be refactored to query Zuora Subscriptions directly using `zuora_account_id` and not use the `Customer` model.  The `account_data_structure` feature flag should not be necessary to use if querying Zuora Subscriptions directly.

Another option that would require the feature flag: Consider fetching the subscriptions via the matching `BillingAccount` instead of the `Customer` as it also has access to the `raw_subscriptions` method.

120556316,2022-12-16 21:56:56.935,Refactor Invoices to use Account instead of Customer,"### Proposal

References of `current_customer.zuora_account_id` in [`InvoicesController`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb#L35) could be updated to `current_zuora_account.id` because the `require_zuora_account` before_action is used.  Using `current_zuora_account` is preferable as it allows us to transition to multiple billing accounts per customer more easily, as this would be fewer places to update in a later iteration.

More importantly, the [`InvoicesFinder`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ccc5b4d03aaa3929ab72b3a36fdc7b6eb14d672c/app/finders/invoices_finder.rb#L3), which is only [referenced once](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e9eaf1283947f750b763c9e179626f0bbb341284/app/controllers/invoices_controller.rb#L11) in the app the `InvoicesController`, can be refactored as well.  This service should accept a `Zuora::Account` instead of a `customer`, as all that is used from customer is `zuora_account_id`.",2
120556198,2022-12-16 21:49:59.621,Redefine zuora_account_id in the Customer model,"### Problem

There are many places in the app where the `zuora_account_id` attribute is referenced Customer.  However, when the `account_data_structure` feature flag is enabled, we want to avoid using this attribute.  Instead, the Customer's membership to a BillingAccount should be used.

### Proposal

The easiest way to iterate towards a solution is to override the `zuora_account_id` getter method that ActiveRecord provides.  Something like the following might work:

```ruby
# customer.rb

def zuora_account_id
  if Unleash.enabled?(:account_data_structure)
    billing_accounts.pick(:zuora_account_id)
  else
    super
  end
end
```

We should consider memoizing this method as well to avoid multiple queries to billing_accounts, if the `zuora_account_id` is referenced multiple times (which it must be in some places).

This will allow us to continue using `customer.zuora_account_id` throughout the app but use the new BillingAccount structure to fetch the `zuora_account_id` when the feature flag is enabled.  

I think there could be places where we reference `zuora_account_id` from a Customer where we want the actual attribute instead of the overridden method (iow. value from the BillingAccount), even after the feature flag is enabled.   These could be updated to pull directly from the attribute (e.g. `customer['zuora_account_id']`) instead of using `customer.zuora_account_id`.  The [backfill rake tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/361c240649937ca9d00c9e74837f3ea7902496a8/lib/tasks/data_maintenance/billing_accounts/backfill_with_customers.rake#L17) for example.

This will apply to many usages throughout the app, including these below:
- [`Customer#mark_as_confirmed`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/95e76dcb7a135079d7bdc7ad511bce9ce95c573c/app/models/customer.rb#L61)

120555296,2022-12-16 21:19:24.348,Use billing_account instead of customer_id on Orders,"### Problem

As of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4804+, the `billing_account_id` column exists on Orders.  The `BillingAccount` has a `zuora_account_id` attribute which should be the SSoT for the association to the Zuora Account.  The `BillingAccount` also has memberships with Customers.  However, the Orders table still has a reference to the `customer_id` as well.  There are likely many places where the billing account associated with the Order should be used instead of the Customer.

### Proposal

When the `account_data_structure` feature flag is enabled, the `billing_account` associated with the Order could be used instead of `customer` in many cases.  For example, when the customer is used simply to access the Zuora Account.  In other cases, we could access customers through the billing account memberships.

### Problem

We want to remove duplicated logic from `TestAccountCleanupCronJob` and `TestDataCleanupTask` to avoid these diverging in the future as a result to changes on one but not the other. Ultimately conceptually feels like this logic should be similar.

### Proposal

Consolidate logic from `TestAccountCleanupCronJob` and `TestDataCleanupTask`
1. Extract the cleanup logic into a service including:
  - `remove_zuora_data`: extract to be reused
  - `remove_sf_data`: extract to be reused
  - `customer` deletion
1. Look into using `request_with_retries` in this consolidated logic by either:
  - using it consistently for all cases (I like this approach)
  - passing a `retry:` parameter.
- Call the new cleanup service directly from `TestAccountCleanupCronJob` and `TestDataCleanupTask`

**This issue** proposes to redefine the `salesforce_account_id` meaning at the `Customer` instance level to use its related billing account based on the status for the `:account_data_structure` feature flag.

Note: The legacy code will be removed in a later issue once the feature flag has been vetted and promoted in production.

### Proposal

Redefine `customer#salesforce_account_id` method to:

```ruby
def salesforce_account_id
  strong_memoize(:salesforce_account_id) do
    if Unleash.enabled?(:account_data_structure)
      billing_accounts.pick(:salesforce_account_id)
    else
      super
    end
  end
end

FYI, we might not be able to use `strong_memoize` to memoize the feature flagged code.  I ran into problems unit testing with this implementation.  In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6164, I ended up using `@zuora_account_id ||= billing_accounts.pick(:zuora_account_id)` instead.

This should account for all the simple / direct usages of the `salesforce_account_id` in the context of:
- `Salesforce::CreateAccountWorker`
- `Update `CreateSalesforceContactService`
- `TestAccountCleanupCronJob` (refactor recommended: Issue 2)
- `TestDataCleanupTask` (refactor recommended: Issue 2)
- `Api::CustomersController`

### Acceptance criteria

1. `salesforce_account_id` is used from the customer when the `:account_data_structure` feature flag is disabled.
1. `salesforce_account_id` is used from the customer's associated billing account when the `:account_data_structure` feature flag is enabled.

the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [ ] Create a merge request to remove `<feature-flag-name>` feature flag
  - [ ] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [ ] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [ ] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [ ] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [ ] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

120528924,2022-12-16 11:57:49.938,Manual testing scenarios for display of ramp subscriptions,"### Proposal
This is the issue to list down the manual testing scenarios before going live with display of ramp subscriptions using the new design.  
Scenarios need to be added in the description.

**EntApps test cases:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xmdJ6ToiCyFNtqjrNPvwcGR7gCvkskjLnZXwAzEMT40/edit#gid=1700034675

### Templates for manual testing
**Note:** _Some of these scenarios are very granular and may not need a separate screenshot / recording. They have been listed so that we can intentionally check these points once all the issues are tackled. Please skip the screenshot column if that scenarios doesn't warrant a separate screenshot as it might be covered in an earlier screenshot._

### Proposal
Add the action buttons section to 
1. Link subscription to GitLab group (only in case of SaaS)
2. Change subscription button which renders a modal telling the customer to get in touch with the sales team to make changes to the subscription.

102642045,2022-01-25 19:44:37.805,Namespace with extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit may prevent subscription provisioning,"**Note:** this issue specifically deals with CI minutes that were added without a purchase (ie via the chatops command) - there is a similar issue that deals with namespaces that have an existing CI minutes pack purchase: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3371+

Came across [a customer](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/263986) (internal) who was unable to link their new subscription purchase through customersDot ""Change linked namespace"".

In the [related sentry error](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/3130777):

> Namespace change to xxxxxxxx is not allowed: Target namespace can't have additional CI minutes

I tracked this down to the customer having been at one point given extra minutes using the chatops function [`namespace minutes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chatops/-/blob/5cdbfaecd14b0a8ee475a0fa3a2f6f09719aad77/lib/chatops/commands/namespace.rb#L65-75), which calls [`GitLab::Client#set_namespace_extra_minutes`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chatops/-/blob/5cdbfaecd14b0a8ee475a0fa3a2f6f09719aad77/lib/chatops/gitlab/client.rb#L42-45) and that invokes the API to set `extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`.

This appears to come from the [namespace validator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1af3fcc24508a25e00b1cecc9f62ba15b7164aa2/lib/validators/namespace_transaction_validator.rb#L34) when called by [`UpdatePlanInfoService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/namespaces/update_plan_info_service.rb):

> if target_namespace.has_extra_shared_runners_minutes?

manually setting that value back to 0 (via API) allowed me to successfully link the customer's subscription from their cDot account.

In [some related discussions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/console-training-wheels/-/merge_requests/100#note_845461902), @tyleramos and @cwiesner noted that this validation may not be needed for all subscription updates, but perhaps more specifically for when a subscription is changing between namespaces.

100985172,2022-01-20 14:30:03.661,Remove obsolete field `usage_ping_required_metrics_enabled` from License,"### Problem

The column `usage_ping_required_metrics_enabled` in the `licenses` table is no longer used and should be removed. It was planned originally as part of Super Sonics but was pretty quickly replaced by the field `operational_metrics_enabled`. I don't believe this field was ever really used. You can find more context about the field change in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3248.

### Proposal

The end goal is to remove this column from the database but must be done in a few steps:

1. [x] - Ignore the column in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4260 (Deployed)
1. [x] - Remove the column from the DB in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4255 (Deployed)

100873104,2022-01-19 00:55:10.822,Add Customers API to check whether customer should see overage alerts for the subscription usage,"### Problem

As part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348481, we need to be able to determine whether customer should see overage alerts for the subscription usage ~~the subscription has the reconciliation flag enabled on Zuora~~, so that we only show alerts for the appropriate subscriptions.

ATM a subscription will be charged for usage overage in [several scenarios](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3934#note_818310692). This would change as we improve the process. If we won't(do not want to , or not ready to) charge the customer for a subscription's usage overage, we do not show the alert(otherwise it is confusing to customer).

This issue will iterate from show alert to `subscription has the reconciliation flag enabled on Zuora`, which I think it includes: 
- `Use case 3: Sale Assisted QSR` in the table.
- `Use case 6: self service QSR` in the table.

### Proposal

Create or modify an endpoint on the customers application to expose this information to the GitLab application and create the functionality on the GitLab application to fetch and cache this data.",5

102491013,2022-01-14 18:03:36.876,[SaaS] Send introductory email about user overages after purchase,"## Problem to solve

SaaS customers are being surprised and taken off-guard by Quarterly Subscription reconciliations. Because self-service SaaS customers have not historically been charged true-ups, the QSR process and the fact that they have to pay for overages is totally new. See tickets from customers [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/337).

## Intended users

This issue is just for SaaS customers.

* Group Owners of a group who has just purchased a subscription
* Only groups enrolled in quarterly subscription reconciliation. See exactly which use cases we're solving for in the [Epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7229#saas-customers).

## Proposal

After a subscription has been purchased for a group in GitLab, send an email to **all** group Owners 1 day after a subscription has been purchased to make them aware of how users are counted and how overages are handled.

We should send an email to all group Owners (not just the group Owner who purchased the subscription), because all group Owners should be aware of the overage behavior.

#### Email copy

Subject line: Managing users in your subscription

Dear [customer],

Thank you for purchasing a GitLab.com subscription! As you get started, we want to make sure you understand some important billing information.

Your subscription cost is based on the maximum number of seats you use during the billing period. If you reach the number of seats in your subscription, you can continue to add users, but GitLab bills you for the overage. These bills occur every quarter.

Read more about quarterly reconciliation in [our product documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation.html).

If you have any questions about this process, [please reach out](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293). We are happy to assist.

Thank you for your business!

100615762,2022-01-13 22:53:28.795,Zuora Central Sandbox Refresh procedures,"### Problem

Last time [Zuora Central Sandbox was refreshed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/477), Fulfillment engineers were blocked from using CustomersDot stg while the refresh was happening, but even ran into to problems after the refresh was completed.  For instance, many engineers needed to request Zuora User access again to be able to log into the [Zuora web app](https://test.zuora.com/).  ~""Enterprise Applications"" apps is already working on improving the refresh process by putting together [this playbook of refresh steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smfh7LnmKZYtQ5c9GfHxrhs5-7yUkIJQ4N1fywjNMq4/edit).

Another common problem encountered by people testing in CustomersDot stg after the refresh was the inability to make purchases ([example 1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327896#note_808722682), [example 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/477#note_807833598)).  This was due to the fact that Customers in CDot stg had `zuora_account_id`s that no longer referenced accounts in Zuora Central Sandbox post refresh.  We are introducing a rake task in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4229 which will clear these orphaned `zuora_account_ids` from CDot stg.

This issue is aimed at identifying any other ways we can improve our post-refresh steps as it pertains to CustomersDot.  Are there any other models that should be updated or cleared?  Here are some thoughts I had, but @fulfillment-group/be please offer up others you might have:

- Instead of simply clearing the `zuora_account_id` for customers, would there be value in truncating the entire `customers` table?  People using CDot stg could simply sign up for new customer accounts to avoid confusion.
- Consider truncating the `orders` table in CDot.  Given that `orders` is strongly tied to Zuora, this table is largely broken when Zuora is refreshed.  Orders with references to `zuora_subscription_name` and `zuora_subscription_id` would be broken.  Should we just start from a clean slate?  In fact, we risk running into collisions if we don't rectify this.

These are just a few idea to start us off.  Please feel free to add to this list or add your thoughts.

### Proposal

Create a rake task to truncate DB tables affected by the Zuora refresh.  This might be as simple as using the following command to truncate a list of tables:

```
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.truncate_tables([:table1_name, :table2_name])
```

This is a list of tables we could consider not truncating:

* `admins`
* `customers`: we will clear the zuora_account_ids that no longer match using a separate rake task
* `features`: to have the correct states of flipper feature flags after the refresh
* `feature_gates`
* `schema_migrations`
* `zuora_user_with_hosts`
* `coupons`: Check with @rcobb if this can/should be truncated
* `leads`: Check with `@a_akgun` if this can/should be truncated

We could include `local_records` in the list of tables to truncate but we'd need to recreate this data by [running the following command](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f293ff2309025232e67d51c95171a8150cbf61e3/README.md#update-product-information): `IronBank::LocalRecords.export`.",3

### Problem
Zuora CPQ data in SFDC changes once Orders is enabled in the related Zuora environment.  CDot integrates with SFDC and interacts with Zuora CPQ data.

### Proposal
Peer into business logic in CDot to understand if there are references to known Zuora CPQ data in SFDC that is changing.  List of impacted fields is found here:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/493#summary-findings-orders-with-quote-studio-v-production-no-orders

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
Fulfillment team can sign off that normal booking processes between CDot<>Salesforce will not break due to the known CPQ data changes.

### Next steps (if any)
Nothing additional to the Proposal

### How will we measure success?

100217894,2022-01-06 19:46:18.027,[UX] Update subscription card with Ramp data and appropriate actions on Manage Subscriptions page,"## Problem

In order to support the new Zuora Orders and Ramps objects, we need to rethink 1) how ramped subscriptions should be displayed for the customers in the UI; and 2) what actions should be available for the ramped subscriptions.

1. When a subscription with Ramps is created in Zuora, it does not currently display clearly on the Manage Purchases page. 
1. Due to the complex nature of a Ramp deal, [sales ops has requested](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/505#note_809749301) that users cannot self-add seats or renew a ramp. They should instead be directed to sales.

For additional details about Ramps, [demos](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748#ramp-demos-in-zuora-and-sfdc) and [sample data](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748#sample-data), see the parent epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748+

## Proposal

### What we show to the customer

1. Display every ramp period on the subscription card, so that the customer is aware how many seats they have access to for the time period.
2. Hide all subscription action buttons (other than link subscription to SaaS group), and display a message that directs the customer to Sales for subscription changes ([sales ops' request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/505#note_809749301)).

### What the customer can do

The subscription will be view only. Customer will not be able to make changes to the subscription via Customer Portal.

## Design

This is a fairly complicated topic, and updating how we display information in the subscription card is a major part of this, so I've recorded 2 videos to walk through the context and the changes.

* [Part 1/2: Ramps overview and why we can't use the current subscription card to display ramps](https://www.loom.com/share/d7fb7744acd14815ae909a64afacf6a4) (4 mins)
* [Part 2/2: Overview of subscription card changes and how ramped subscriptions are shown in the subscription card](https://www.loom.com/share/8f48c533691c43a6ac6349f1c7d37a13) (7.5 mins)

Questions that are answered in the video:

* Why can't we use the existing subscription card for ramps display?
* How does Zuora structure ramps data?
* What is the new subscription card display that's being proposed?
* How are we iterating into a new subscription card display? What is the MVC?

As I mentioned in the video, ramps will be the MVC of the subscription card information hierarchy updates. We'll handle other use cases in later iterations, and I've opened up [an issue for that](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5317). In the design section of this issue, you'll only find ramps-related mockups, so if you're looking for mockups for other use cases they can be found in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5317.

### Suggestion

We should keep only one view. I would suggest to stick with a more simple one (current root). We should clean up th `SubscriptionController#index` and remove unnedeed views.

### Tech details to take care of during implementation (thanks @qzhaogitlab for checking it):

Check the details in the [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4124#note_752931041)

:arrow_right: This is the direction we chose.

* update `SubscriptionsController#index` to show a different (root) view
* clean up the `VisitorsController` -> previously, `VisitorsController`(as the root_url) handled both `authenticated` and `unauthenticated` users. Now we can keep only `handle_signed_in_user`
* cleanup old subscription index view & modal

:arrow_right: If we decide to keep /subscription page template (but we didn't!)

We could simply set `root to: 'subscriptions#index'` in [config/routes.rb](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1a001e7db7b361b49dd4c2afb5fea829cc831955/config/routes.rb#L28)

But then we also need to clean up `SubscriptionsController#index`:

* simplify `@subscriptions = SubscriptionsFinder.for_customer(current_customer)`, just the same as current `VisitorsController#index`
* update the view file",2

```

After some investigation, we determined the source of the bug was a difference between the Order Processed callout and the New Subscription Created callout.

- `New Subscription Created` callout returns `<parameter name=""account_crm_id""></parameter>`
- `Order Processed` callout returns `<parameter name=""account_crm_id"">null</parameter>`

You can see this in the callout history for [this customer in api sandbox](https://apisandbox.zuora.com/apps/CustomerAccount.do?method=view&id=8ad09f8a7d769bad017d7990c06f3883).

### Proposal

Despite this likely being a bug in Zuora given the discrepancy in how the callouts are handled, we can account for this in CustomersDot when parsing the callout attributes from the request body.  CustomersDot can handle `""null""` value as a empty string.  The `Order Processed` callout should then be processed like other callouts at that point.",2
98197756,2021-11-30 20:16:30.177,Instance not able to seat link using existing cloud license,"### Problem

As described in these Slack threads ([first](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C029YFPUA6M/p1637926425309000) and [second](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01BPM66KNE/p1638280781120700)), [a customer](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/221264) who was previously using a license file for their SM subscription ([link to Zuora subscription](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a129bb27d37d510017d3a23c8b814a6)), renewed their subscription (on Nov 19) before it was set to expire on Nov 24.  They decided to activate the renewed subscription on Nov 22.  The customer was understandably confused because the new synced cloud license showed information from the subscription term that was about to expire.  They waited until Nov 24 to see if the new subscription details would be synced but found they didn't sync.  Attempts to manually sync the subscription were also unsuccessful.

On Nov 24, when the new subscription term was set to start, CustomersDot received a seat link request at 03:26:17 and a [cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009153) was generated for the new term, but this license didn’t seem to get persisted to the instance. Because the new license didn’t get persisted, all future seat link attempts from the instance (auto or manual) used [its current (outdated) license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009081) key.  In this particular case, it appears the seat link requests for the previous day (report_timestamp = 2021-11-23 12:00:14) updated the LicenseSeatLink records instead of creating new ones.  As part of that update, the `license_id` was updated to [the new cloud license](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/1009153).  The link to the instance’s license was lost.

We can see this in the previous versions of this LicenseSeatLink:
```
license seat link (ver 1):
  id: 2832633
  report_timestamp: 2021-11-23 12:00:14
  updated_at: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:59:57
  license_id: 1009080

license seat link (ver 2):
  updated_at: Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:02:36
  license_id: 1009081 (a new license because customer `name` changed)

license seat link (ver 3):
  updated_at: Wed, 24 Nov 2021 03:26:17
  license_id: 1009153 (a new license because `users_count` changed to 30)
```

This meant the [lookup here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8c1409ed275594ae63487d1fb85a726297c296f5/app/controllers/api/v1/seat_links_controller.rb#L59) to find the `SelfManagedInstanceActivation` record will no longer work with the existing license.  That’s why we see from Nov 24 until a workaround was used to fix seat link that all `LicenseSeatLink` records created (between nov 24 to 30) did not have a corresponding `license_id` (because they were not considered part of ""cloud sync"".

### Proposal

CustomersDot should avoid updating `license_id` in the `SeatLinkCreateService`, and instead simply add a new `LicenseSeatLink` record instead.  If this logic were used, the next manual or auto seat link request from the customer's instance likely would have resolved the seat link connection and persisted the license for the new term.",2

# Bug

## Summary

A customer pre-purchase Additional storage for their group namespace while none of the project under the namespace has reached the 10GB limit. When the customer try to do git Push which cause the project to go above the 10GB limit, the push is rejected.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Purchase Additional Storage for a namespace when none of the project has reach the limit yet
1. Do a git push to the project that would cause the project to go above the 10GB limit
1. Observe the push being rejected

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Git push is rejected even though there's additional storage available for the group that the project is under.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Git push command should come through when there's additional storage available.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it's tough to read otherwise.)

```
batch response: Your push has been rejected, because this repository has exceeded its size limit of 10 GB by 660 MB. Please contact your GitLab administrator for more information.
Uploading LFS objects: 0% (0/30), 0 B | 0 B/s, done.
```

## Workarounds

Reach out to support so we can manually change the limit as a workaround.

97186348,2021-11-11 16:54:09.844,QSR Amendment.Name Process + Orders API,"### Problem

Quarterly Subscription Reconciliation (QSR) and Auto-Renewal amendments are currently being identified in Zuora by by populating Amendment.Name with the following:

1. `Automated seat reconciliation` - for QSR
2. `AutoRenew by CustomersDot` - for Auto-Renewal

These Amendment Names are also being used to identify invoices related to QSR and Auto-Renewal.

With the full transition to Zuora Orders, the Amendment object is being replaced by the Order objects.  As part of this epic https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8665+, we will stop using Amendments to make subscription changes.  Therefore, we need a way to identify QSR and Auto-Renewal on the Order and Invoice objects.

### Proposal

1. **Transitioning from Amendment.Name:** use the `Order.Description` field when we transition to Orders API. This will be sufficient in identifying Orders that are generated from the QSR/Auto-Renewal processes, even if multiple order actions are utilized in the auto-renewal process. (this issue).
    - [x] QSR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3784 (this issue)
    - [x] Auto renewal: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5017 
2. **Traversing from Order to Invoice**: to ensure a completely accurate 1:1 relationship between Order and Invoice, we should stamp the Invoice with a value to identify QSR/Auto-Renewal. (epic: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8898)

### Result

Orders and Invoices related to QSR and Auto-Renewal are easy to identify in Zuora.

97110941,2021-11-10 15:41:31.871,Use constants for amendment types consistently,"## Proposal

Amendment types are referenced inconsistently throughout the CustomersDot code.  There is an `Amendment::Types` module where type constants are defined and these constants are used in some places.  There are different constants defined in `AmendGenerator`.  In many other places, strings are used instead of constants.  Let's update CustomersDot to reference one set of constants if possible.  It probably makes sense to define all the possible constants in `Amendment::Types`.

The following discussion from !4063 should be addressed:

### Problem
After the implementation of [[BE, FE] Improve trial license generation user experience in CustomersDot (#101)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/license-gitlab-com/-/issues/101) it is no longer possible to create Starter trial licenses. \
This makes sense for (potential) customers as the Starter plan is being phased out, and no longer available as a new subscription. \
The L&R Support team however has to create temporary Starter licenses on a very regular basis, to help out customers that are still on Starter and experiencing problems during renewal. At the request of the Sales team or by L&R Support's own initiative a temporary license is provided to ensure continuity.

### Proposal

Re-instate the ability to generate a trial starter plan in Customers Portal app for the L&R Support team.

Note: Teresa: I'm thinking it's a simple rollback but please let me know if not.

### Result
The L&R Support team can create Starter temporary licenses again.

### Next steps (if any)

### How will we measure success?
Happy customers, happy L&R Support team, happy Sales team.

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Consider announcing that the flag will be enabled to potentially impacted groups, e.g. `#s_fulfillment_engineering`
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] Announce on [the feature issue](ISSUE LINK) an estimated time this will be enabled on production if applicable
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment 
- [x] Announce on [the feature epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6806) that the feature has been globally enabled.
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `redirect_plans_page` feature flag https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/4124
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the Unleash feature flag from the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](LINK TO THE FEATURE FLAG EDIT PAGE)",1

96954185,2021-11-08 16:45:58.374,Ramps Discovery: Review Ramp subscription data in Zuora to inform provisioning plan,"### Problem

The overall goal of this issue is to learn how CustomersDot supports ramps (multi-year subscriptions) once Orders Harmonization is live in Zuora Central Sandbox and the `orders_harmonization` feature is enabled in customers.staging.gitlab.com.  Orders Harmonization will be tested as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343474 so that issue is a blocker for this.

~""Enterprise Applications"" will be creating use cases as part of an investigative spike issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/385#investigative-spike.  

### Proposal

Once [Orders Harmonization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6641) dev work is complete and the feature has been enabled in CustomersDot staging, ~""Enterprise Applications"" will create Ramp use cases in Zuora API Sandbox and Zuora Central Sandbox as documented in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/129).  This is estimated to start 2021-11-15, and completed by 2021-11-19.

The Fulfillment team will observe and document behavior in CustomersDot.  We should be able to start this effort by 2021-11-22.

Here's a list of this we should check:
- Were callouts received and processed as expected for ramp subscriptions?
  - Emails delivered?
  - Offline license generated for 1st year of subscription?
- Are ramp subscriptions displayed correctly in the ""Manage Subscriptions"" page for customers?
  - Does the download/copy License function as expected?  It should have created the license for the first year of the subscription's multi-year term.
- Is support able to manually create licenses effectively for the 2nd year or later of the multi year subscription?

If anything is found that requires Fulfillment work, we should note it in this issue and notify @teresatison as it could impact the delivery date for Ramps.

96273916,2021-10-25 19:27:26.442,Licensing Email to Partner,"## Summary

Today, licensing emails are sent to the End User: Sold To contact. Given the 3-tier model of these orders, the Partner Contact facilitating the purchase of GitLab needs to receive the licensing email in addition to the End User.  For detailed requirements about licensing email updates, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132).

## Requirements

Customize the existing license email for e-marketplace orders to send a courtesy cop (cc) the Reseller Contact.

## Scope

- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/445

## Proposal

- CustomersDot does have some logic already for resellers.
  - If a subscription is considered to be managed by a reseller (e.g. `invoice_owner_id != account_id`), then the customer account associated with the subscription will not be allowed to login to CustomersDot.
  - When the license email is sent to the customer and the subscription is managed by a reseller, a reseller notification email is sent to the reseller. The email used for the reseller is pulled from the work_email of the subscription invoice_owner contact account.
- The [issue description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/132#details) states the ""contact is different from the Sell To, Invoice Owner, or Bill To contacts and will most likely not be stored in Zuora"". Given that, it sounds like we would have to fetch this information from SFDC which would be new work. However, the step to create data in SFDC is after this step, so I'm not sure where we should get this information.
- I'm curious what this means for the existing reseller logic. Would this need to be modified or disabled for E-Disty subscriptions?
- Would the Partner Contact email address be added to the existing email, or would it require a new email with specialized copy? The former would likely be less effort.
- Weight: 3-5 (This one is difficult to say with certainty based on the questions above)

96273949,2021-10-25 19:17:31.820,[Purchase] SubscribeService: CustomersDot Data,"## Summary

After Zuora has received all the necessary information, the SubscribeService API should create the customer account with all related info in CustomersDot. The customer then needs to be provisioned a license(s).  For detailed requirements for what records and data need to be created in Customers Dot, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/134).

## Requirements

Ensure all customer, subscription and license records are created in CustomersDot.

## Proposal

- The [issue description here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/129#cdot-data-creation) mentions ""After Zuora has received all necessary information, the SubscribeService API should create the customer account"". I'm wondering if this is a hard requirement for the customer account to be created after. The `SubscribeService` in CDot currently requires a customer object so it would likely be easier to reuse this service if we created the customer before sending the information to Zuora.
- I have some questions about the [list of fields here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/134#customersdot-data-requirements), but I don't think we have to work through these now as they probably wouldn't impact the LOE significantly.

96273702,2021-10-25 19:07:13.044,[Purchase] SubscribeService: Zuora Data,"## Summary

Once compliance has passed, the SubscribeService API should create the customer account and related subscription information in Zuora. For detailed requirements for what records and data need to be created in Zuora, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/127).

## Requirement

Ensure all customer and subscription records are created in Zuora.

## Proposal

- Based on the current requirements in the [issue description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/127#zuora-requirements), I think Fulfillment engineers would have a difficult task knowing what's expected of the new subscribe API endpoint right now. This might be my confusion, but I thought the purpose of this issue was to define the transaction from CustomersDot into Zuora. However, the description includes information about Quote-related objects, which I thought were SFDC-related, and that this information would be fed into SFDC after successful entry into Zuora (as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/bsa/business-systems-analysts/-/issues/128).
- What would be helpful to assess LOE for this issue might be to understand what exactly needs to be sent in the subscribe API request to Zuora. Or another way to think about it might be to understand how this the Zuora subscribe request differs from the current request from a web direct purchase.
- Just to confirm, the new CustomersDot API will only handling new subscription purchases, correct? Or does it also need to handle subscription updates from Arrow.
- Weight:8 (based on the unknowns so far)

96106871,2021-10-25 18:52:38.758,Visual Compliance Check for E-Disty,"## Summary

When an order is first submitted, received by Platypus and by Customers API, a callout to Visual Compliance must be made to validate that the End User information is on a denied parties list. [This document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hD1xgEyJL1U1eyvTci6NNlCdIur4PkB16GO52wjZRgk/edit#slide=id.g5d8fd53174_0_44) provides more information on how Visual Compliance works today for sales assisted deals.

If compliance check fails, Arrow needs to be notified of order rejection. If compliance check passes, the order should proceed and data should continue to flow through GitLab's internal systems.

## Requirement

Ensure all Arrowsphere Orders are submitted through Visual Compliance prior to booking.

## Potential Options

### Option 1: Use CDot Existing API

- A pre-requisite to this step will be to [enable VC in CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393), date TBD.
- The `ComplianceCheckService` can likely be re-used for the new subscribe API endpoint to be used by Platypus.
  * Currently the `ComplianceCheckService` is utilized in a `before_action` filter for a few controller actions: customer registration and subscriptions controller actions (new, edit, renew, autorenew).
- The tricky part will be making sure the input from Arrow matches the expectation for the visual compliance API. It expects 3 parameters: `company`, `country`, `state`. It's difficult to say because we don't have access to docs, but I believe it uses [the ISO_3166 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).
- The other piece to sort out is what to do when compliance fails. The requirements say ""Arrow needs to be notified of order rejection"". Are there any more specifics known for this requirement? Is Arrow looking for a specific HTTP code? I'm not sure we need to know all the specifics at this point for estimation, as long as the expected response isn't too involved.


### Option 2: Create Platypus Callout
* The original decision for e-disty implementation was for Platypus to own the compliance check
* After meeting with Visual Compliance, API setup does seem straightforward & doable, however there will be an additional cost to proceeding this way

##### Pricing Info
* Annual price of approximately 12,000 USD given standard 3 year term and leveraging of existing Gitlab/Descartes Visual Compliance master terms
* One-time $2,500 integration service and activation setup fee for the initial implementation effort which covers a dedicated implementation consultant, sandbox/test environment, and concierge service to ensure solution is up and running as efficiently as possible

## Proposal

As of June 2 2022, we are leaning towards implementing Option 1, with some alterations.  The original plan for Option 1 was to first enable existing VC solution (as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3393).  The existing VC solution was disabled in production because of a discrepancy between the countries that VC was blocking and the countries that GitLab wanted to block.  However, with v1 of the Distributor e-Marketplace solution with Arrowsphere, we only need to account for US-based orders, making the existing VC API a possibility at least in the short-term.

The current proposal is to implement and enable VC just for the marketplace API as a short-term solution to be able to release v1.  Long-term, the VC solution in CDot will be replaced with RiskRate.",3
95692923,2021-10-19 12:28:14.371,Backend: Update orders table to set product_rate_plan_id of new OSS plan (for existing orders),"### Problem to solve

We need to update GL.com database to set GitLab subscription hosted_plan_id of `opensource` after the CustomersDot is able to sync `opensource` for Order having a subscription `Plan::ULTIMATE_SAAS_OSS_1_YEAR`.

### Proposal

- [x] Write a rake task to do the following 
     1. Find the Orders within CustomersDot having product_rate_plan_id = Plan::ULTIMATE_SAAS_OSS_1_YEAR
     1. Sync changes to the gl_namespace_id within order to GL.com to update gitlab_subscriptions as `opensource`
- [x] Get the MR merged into main branch.
- [x] Verify the rake command on staging.  
- [x] Turn on the flag `opensource_plans` for production. 
- [x] Run the rake task and verify that the data is updated correctly

In case there is an unexpected error

1. Turn off the [flag `opensource_plan`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
2. Invoke OnCall duty person to run the following on GL.com console. 

```ruby
GitlabSubscription.where(hosted_plan_id: 135).update_all(hosted_plan_id: 101)

95679216,2021-10-19 10:33:53.124,Sync opensource plan code to GL when order is created,"### Description

Zuora issues a callback when a Zuora admin/sales creates a `opensource` subscription for a customer. 

The customer receives an email about the new subscription and steps to assign a namespace to the new subscription. 

The CustomersDot need to [sync `opensource` plan id](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/gitlab/namespaces/update_plan_info_service.rb#L124) to GL.com. This would notify the GL.com to use the `opensource` plan for the namespace.  

### Proposal

Update method [PlansFinder find](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/61b2dead60696ac0a9bddbbbc69890f217f2ea75/app/models/plans_finder.rb#L53) method to return plan_id as opensource for the OSS product_rate_plan_i

When investigating Purchase error spend (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/342844), it was observed that the `/gitlab_plans` endpoint is slow to respond.

> If `namespace_id` is provided, it will be used to lookup the related order for that namespace and find the associated subscription in Zuora ([code reference](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/2c3cd06d36ec0a1535fca0ee96b7bfee2b36b052/app/controllers/plans_controller.rb#L34)). Later, the products are also fetched from Zuora and this is a slow process (\~1.3s on my local machine). This is necessary to determine which plan the namespace is already using, price for upgrades, etc. We will likely need to focus our efforts on ways to improve this lookup.

94785821,2021-10-04 09:38:51.024,Provide an alternative to using ngrok in local environments,"### Problem

Related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2466 - after configuring Gitpod, we realised that `ngrok` was also needed for callout configuration.

According to https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/#other-servicesdevices

> Do not use tools designed to circumvent network firewalls for the purpose of exposing your laptop to the public Internet. An example of this would be using ngrok to generate a public URL for accessing a local development environment. 

### Proposal

Replace ngrok with an indirect proxy that forwards callouts from Zuora without the need to open a port in your computer. A few alternatives I thought of:

- Use https://gitlab.com/jameslopez/zsim to simulate the callouts API by querying the Zuora notifications API
- Create a proxy server that receives all dev callouts from Zuora and displays a copy & paste `curl` URL+payload we could replay in our local environment (Okta log in needed into the tool)

### Result

[To Be Determined]

In [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3556#note_692789137) we discussed a couple of ways to approach this.

* Proposed solution A: Remove purchased date from the display on subscription card in the FE, then remove reference from the presenter
* Proposed solution B: If solution A does not work, we could replace `created_at` with the original RPC created_date (same as the solution for CI minutes)

Update: As of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3556#note_692928087, we decided to keep purchase date information for now (unless it turns out to be a big problem to implement).  We'll go with proposed solution B.

This error is due to 2 things:

1. The Subscription from the callout was already cancelled so it is not found in the Zuora query because we only find Active Subscriptions [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8cd4b49bb71c00887b5c3dd99bd07b339743d186/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L32).
1. The SubscriptionTermStart callout must be defined incorrectly in Zuora production.  I noticed the `subscription_id` actually contains a leading space in the XML body which you can see in the Sentry error (see below).  This causes [the fallback query here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/8cd4b49bb71c00887b5c3dd99bd07b339743d186/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L33) not to find the subscription either.

### Problem
In the sales process, salespeople are required to provide information on a Quote about the CDot User that is managing the particular purchase.  For sales-engaged new biz, the contact that is ultimately passed to Zuora as the Zuora Sold To associated with the Zuora Account and Subscription is used to create or associate a CDot User with a Zuora Account/Subscription.  For Amendment and Renewal sales-engaged deals, no User management takes place in CDot to associate any new contacts with a namespace.  This causes provisioning lags that impact revenue recognition because license emails may not be sent to the appropriate use (that is not represented in CDot or not associated with a namespace/Zuora Subscription).

### Proposal
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/319#note_676389738

Update [the `FindOrCreateCustomersService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/a370c2b4b1a4fec50a6be2291c7b0ec7c73e0cd7/app/services/find_or_create_customer_service.rb#L34) to only find Customers using email address.  This means avoid the fallback find logic using `zuora_account_id`.  If new sold to contact information is received in a callout and the email address does not exist, CDot should create a new customer and associate it to the order and account.

### Result
All sales-engaged deals have Zuora Sold-To contact created and/or associated with a Zuora Subscription/Account/Namespace.

### Next steps (if any)
Fulfillment (@tgolubeva) and EntApps (@mquitevis) have already brainstormed a high-level solution.  Next steps are Fulfillment prioritization and working on a detailed solution.

### How will we measure success?
The Zuora Sold To Contact received licensing emails for all deal types (New business, Amendments, Renewals)

93938053,2021-09-20 00:35:00.386,Community Programs - update the login/register flow to reflect UX design,"### Problem

Related to this bug discovered during testing https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/311#note_677677051

When going through the Community Program signup flow, a customer is asked to register/login first, then select the plan type (SaaS or Self-Manage). If they select SaaS, they are dropped into the checkout page without a way to create a group.  This video shows the current experience https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/311#note_678467160

The original design asked for a different flow.

The SaaS or SM selection should be prior to sign in, and [here's the reasoning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2677/designs/User_flow.png#note_531957098). A SaaS customer should never see the option to Sign in or Register, only the `Continue with Gitlab.com account` button. If we don't do it this way and the SaaS customer registers a new CustomersDot account, it won't be connected to their GitLab.com account and they won't be able to complete the flow. 


### Proposal

Update the flow to reflect the UX design.

* exclude the landing page from requiring a user login
* when accessing the claim page:
  * if no login: redirect to either register page (for self-managed) or to log in with GitLab page (for SaaS) based on `edition` query string variable
  * if the user is logged in, continue the flow to the claim page without any redirect

93821802,2021-09-17 00:43:44.223,[Engineering]: Pitch a paid plan when users click to purchase CI minutes,"# Experiment summary
We believe we can increase paid conversion by informing users of their paid plan options when they go to purchase CI minutes.

# Hypothesis
Users who purchase CI minutes may not know that CI minutes are included with a paid plan. A paid plan may be a better fit for users who are so engaged as to use all of the free minutes allocated to them.

Currently, the experience gives users no information around the free CI minutes included in the paid plans.

# Business problem
At times, the features of our paid plans are not easily found when initially/casually using the platform.

# Proposed Solution

Inform users of the paid plan options on the purchase page.
- For all free users, we present them with information in the form of a banner about upgrading to GitLab Premium. We then link them to the new subscription purchase flow.
- For premium users who are subscription owners, we present them with information in the form of a banner about upgrading to GitLab Ultimate. We then link them to the CustomersDot Upgrade flow.

93800768,2021-09-16 14:49:33.460,Allow Admins to set Zuora Subscription Super Sonics flags to NULL in the Admin UI,"### Problem

Admins are able to check boxes on the Zuora Subscriptions Admin page in CustomersDot which can set a few custom fields in Zuora.  Checking the box sets the field to ""Yes"".  Later if you uncheck a box, it sets the field to ""No"".  This was fine when the initial design assumed all these fields would either be ""Yes"" or ""No"" but NULL is also a valid state, especially in the dual licensing approach.  

![Screen_Shot_2021-09-16_at_10.36.23_AM](/uploads/c19b85d7aba596cb99f3bd9584af22c4/Screen_Shot_2021-09-16_at_10.36.23_AM.png)

Admins should have the ability set the fields to NULL as well.  It's also unclear if an unchecked box means ""No"" or NULL.

### Proposal

Update the Zuora Subscriptions Admin page from using checkboxes to dropdowns that contain all three options: ""Yes"", ""No"", and NULL.

93780933,2021-09-16 09:54:52.318,[Feature Flag] Enable `new_ci_provisioning` flag,"<!-- Title suggestion: [Feature flag] Enable description of feature -->

# Summary

<!-- Short description of what the feature is about and link to relevant other issues. -->

This issue is to rollout the new [CI minutes provisioning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5715) on CustomersDot production,
that is currently behind the [`new_ci_provisioning`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit) feature flag.

## Owners

- Team: ~""group::utilization"" 
- Most appropriate Slack channel to reach out to: `#g_utilization`
- Best individual to reach out to: `@vij`
- PM: `@amandarueda` 

## The Rollout Plan

- Rollout Feature for everyone as soon as it's ready

This feature is running in parallel with existing provisioning and as such is as yet unused on GitLab.com so it can roll out to everyone whilst we monitor and validate the data being created.

## Expectations

### What are we expecting to happen?

We will expect to start seeing API requests in the Kibana logs, between CustomersDot and GitLab.

This will result in the creation of `Ci::Minutes::AdditionalPack` records on GitLab when minutes are purchased, and updates to those packs when linked namespaces are changed.

### What might happen if this goes wrong?

We may see an increase in errors if an unforeseen scenario occurs.

The result of this would be incorrect data being applied in GitLab.com, the severity of which is low because the data is as yet unused and we have a separate rake task for re-syncing the same data which can always run if/when the problem is resolved.

We can disable the feature flag safely if this occurs, which will prevent further data creation.

### What can we monitor to detect problems with this?

We can/should monitor the following after enabling:

**Staging:**

- [#s_fulfillment_status](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL7SX4N86)
- [Kibana logs for API endpoints](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net/goto/2b4f611b3e6c912061b19e1502722cf5)
- [Create packs Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+syncminutesjob)
- [Transfer packs Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+transfer)


**Production:**

- [#s_fulfillment_status](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CL7SX4N86)
- [Kibana logs for API endpoints](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/goto/dad196f12169b034bd809671da17fb2b)
- [Create packs Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+syncminutesjob)
- [Transfer packs Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/?query=is%3Aunresolved+transfer)

## Rollout Steps

### Rollout on non-production environments

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to non-production environments, i.e. `customers-staging`.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on non-production environments by applying the appropriate environment, e.g. `customers-staging` and `customers-development`.
- [x] Verify that the feature works as expected. Posting the QA result in this issue is preferable.

### Preparation before production rollout

- [x] Ensure that the feature MRs have been deployed to production
- [x] Check if the feature flag change needs to be accompanied with a
  [change management issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#feature-flags-and-the-change-management-process).
  Cross link the issue here if it does.
- [x] Ensure that you or a representative in Fulfillment can be available for at least 2 hours after feature flag updates in production.
  If a different developer will be covering, or an exception is needed, please inform the Fulfillment team in #s_fulfillment_engineering
- [x] Ensure any documentation has been updated
- [x] If the feature might impact the user experience, notify `#s_fulfillment` and potentially `#support_gitlab-com`, as well as your team channel ([more guidance when this is necessary in the dev docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change)).

### Global rollout on CustomersDot production

- [x] Confirm the feature flag is enabled on `staging` without incident
- [ ] Roll out the feature to targeted testing users first (if applicable)
- [ ] If applicable, [incrementally roll out](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/feature_flags.html#percent-rollout) the feature.
- [ ] Verify the change has the desired outcome with the limited rollout before enabling the feature globally on production.
- [x] Enable the feature globally on production environment 
- [x] Wait for [at least one day for the verification term](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).

### Release the feature

After the feature has been [deemed stable](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release),
the clean up should be done as soon as possible to permanently enable the feature and reduce complexity in the codebase.

<!-- The checklist here is to help stakeholders keep track of the feature flag status -->
- [x] Create a merge request to remove `new_ci_provisioning` feature flag
  - [x] Remove all references to the feature flag from the codebase
- [x] Ensure that the cleanup MR has been deployed to both staging and production
- [x] Disable the feature flag via the [CustomersDot dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags)
- [x] Ensure production environment is still working as expected
- [x] Remove the [Unleash feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit)
- [x] Close this rollout issue.

## Rollback Steps

- [ ] This feature can be disabled by performing the following actions:
  - [ ] Disable the Unleash flag on the [feature flag page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/102/edit)",1

Admins are able to view Cloud Activation data in the Admin UI currently, but the information shown is very basic.  The fields include subscription name, activation code, created date, and super sonics aware.

It would be useful for Admins to be able to tell if a customer has activated any instances with a particular code, and when that might have occurred.

### Proposal

For a particular `CloudActivation` record, we should add a link to another page listing all of the `SelfManagedInstanceActivations`.  We would need to join information from the `SelfManagedInstances` table as well

This page could be a simple table with the following columns:

- `self_managed_instances.instance_identifier`
- `self_managed_instance_activations.activated_at`

### Result

An Admin could easily tell if/when instances have been activated with a particular activation code.

93654648,2021-09-14 16:05:57.137,[CI Minutes Provisioning] AdditionalPack testing plan,"### Summary

We have introduced a new concept of an `Ci::Minutes::AdditionalPack` model on GitLab for handling the new provisioning of CI minutes purchases from CustomersDot.

This new model has API endpoints that allow us to (re-)sync purchased packs as well as transfer them between namespaces (currently, only when subscriptions are moved).

Further information is available in the proposal document, [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/doc/ci_minutes/provisioning_proposal.md).

The current status of this work is that creation and transferring of packs is implemented, but currently un-used on the GitLab side (see the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5715) for more detail).

This means that CI minutes balance and consumption is still using the old `namespace#extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit`, so although the individual parts are tested at a unit level, we can't easily write E2E tests for this _new_ provisioning yet (someone please correct me if there's a simple way of doing this without UI changes to test against).

So for now, in order to test the current work end to end, I've created a test plan that I've been working against which I'll document here.

We can use this plan for checking off scenarios during our manual testing, and eventually using it as a basis for writing automated QA tests.


### Setup

As mentioned above, given there's no UI you can use to verify changes on the GitLab side, we'll need to use a rails console to do it manually, so firstly, here are some (hopefully) useful console snippets for verifying each step:

**Ensure feature flag enabled: **

```ruby
Unleash.enabled?(:new_ci_provisioning)
```

This is currently [toggled on](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags?scope=featureFlags&page=1) for `customers-development` and `customers-staging` environments.

**Check purchased pack counts on GitLab:**

```ruby
# Total packs count:
Ci::Minutes::AdditionalPack.count

# a User's packs and count:
user.reload
user.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs
user.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs.count
user.namespace.ci_minutes_additional_packs.sum(&:number_of_minutes)

# a Group's packs and count:
group.reload
group.ci_minutes_additional_packs
group.ci_minutes_additional_packs.count
group.ci_minutes_additional_packs.sum(&:number_of_minutes)
```

93355364,2021-09-08 20:47:19.603,Modify the subscription_update endpoint to support an Order Processed callout,"### Background

As discussed in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/322#note_666782612, Order action callouts are triggered for each order action (add product, remove product, etc) added to a processed order.  This is similar to amendment callouts, however there is one big difference.  With Amendments, each Amendment processed yields a new version of the subscription.  This isn't necessarily the case with Order Actions.

When processing Amendment callouts in CustomersDot, CustomersDot will only consider a callout if the subscription status is Active in order to avoid provisioning a subscription multiple times.  For instance, if a subscription was upgraded from premium to ultimate, a `RemoveProduct` amendment and `NewProduct` Amendment would be created but only the last Amendment (e.g. NewProduct) would have an ""Active"" subscription status, as that is the latest subscription.

If we use Order Action callouts, we would need a way to determine the last callout to process and skip the others.  Otherwise, CustomersDot would provision a subscription multiple times.  

### Proposal

Instead of configuring Order Action processed callouts, we should use Order processed callouts.  This would yield only one callout, no matter how many Order Actions were processed, eliminating the step of determining which callout to process.

We'd have to make some adjustments in callout processing code where `amendment_type` is currently referenced.  Callout params would not contain this parameter.  This would have to be queried from the Order Actions types associated with the Order in Zuora.

FYI, it doesn't look like Orders are supported by IronBank, the gem used in CustomersDot.  This will be added as part of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3568.",5
93355169,2021-09-08 20:41:34.627,Update IronBank to support Orders,"### Background

As part of updating CustomersDot to work with the Orders Harmonization feature in Zuora, CustomersDot needs to be able to query Orders and Orders Actions.  This will be helpful in processing ""Order Processed"" callouts sent by Zuora for Order related transactions.

It does not appear that [IronBank](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank), the gem used by CustomersDot to interact with Zuora, supports Order related resources.

### Proposal

Let's investigate whether we can update the IronBank gem to add resources for `Order` and `OrderAction`.  We could also submit a merge request to the IronBank project to contribute to the open source project.

### Proposal

Let's update the `ZuoraCallout::SyncResource::AccountWorker` to no longer log an error for this and instead create the BillingAccount using the data from Zuora.",2

126929027,2023-04-19 14:09:54.372,CI minutes provisioning not working after two days of its purchase,"### Problem

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6102+, a fix to only provision current CI minutes purchases and not future dated one was implemented. It was just discovered when investigating a [failed provision](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C049W1SNRV1/p1681866001597449) that this introduced a new bug which prevents to provision CI minutes if they weren't provisioned within the first two days of its purchase. It turned out that since CI minutes is a one time purchase, the effective period is only two days long:

![Screenshot_2023-04-19_at_12.55.00_PM](/uploads/49ef20d07a3ef4263710e1081ad09770/Screenshot_2023-04-19_at_12.55.00_PM.png)

Before the mentioned issues was implemented, the CustomersDot's `Order` record and its `subscription` record was used. But with the fix the `current_subscription` is used. This led to the CI minutes not being returned after those two days because of this logic [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/bbc73401606fd0a45655c8c00b7f1cc35043192c/app/models/subscription.rb#L82) that only selects products where today's date is covered within their effective dates.

### Proposal

When filtering the products to be effective as of today, add a special condition to check if the product is CI minutes (`rate_plan_charge.rate_plan.product_rate_plan_id == Plan::CI_1000_MINUTES_PLAN`) AND today's date is greater or equal to the effective start date of the rate plan charge.

We could also set the effective end date to be the effective start date + 12 months which would be similar to how it's done on the [GitLab side](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/a584f70cdeb9df7ecda3494daf696bf80d49c3ef/lib/add_ons/ci_minutes_params_generator.rb#L19).

### Result

Return the correct amount of purchased CI minutes for the current subscription regardless of its Zuora effective date period.",2
126889812,2023-04-18 15:41:26.009,Provision failure for cloud license undecided subscriptions,"# Bug

## Summary

When self managed subscription is cloud license undecided (i.e. turn_on_cloud_licensing__c is NULL), and when a license of the same subscription already exists, provision will raise ""NoMethodError: undefined method `valid?' for nil:NilClass"" error.

## What is the current *bug* behavior?

Provision will fail.

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Provision will succeed.

126685278,2023-04-14 20:19:47.997,Skip the invalid country validation on Customer,"### Problem

As described in https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10349+, we want to be able to use BillingAccount Contacts more in CDot instead of using Customer data, and one area in particular for this epic is in Compliance.  We need to remove CDot's dependence on using the `country` attribute on the Customer model for compliance checks when a customer becomes a paid customer.  This allows CDot to more effectively manage BillingAccounts with multiple BillingAccountMemberships.

In particular, there are validations on this attribute on Customer model that should no longer apply for paid Customers.  In order to remove these validations, we want to make sure CDot prevents these Customers/Users from registering to begin with.  Once we effectively prevent registration and purchases, we should be able to remove the validations.

### Proposal

In this issue, CDot should skip the [invalid country validation on Customer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/32cde3637e1a9b987a7dcc8f6354168253ad272f/app/models/customer.rb#L50) when the `compliance_v2` feature flag is enabled.

We are able to safely remove this validation assuming other checks are in place to prevent web-direct purchases up-front.  Those checks will be handled in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6257 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6258.  This will help avoid unexpected errors that are encountered in other unrelated CDot logic.

#### Rollout

We will rollout this change behind a new feature flag called `compliance_v2`.",1
126616973,2023-04-13 19:51:32.459,Embargoed country redundancy check for provisioning-related callout workers,"### Problem

As described in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6053+, there are a few methods of preventing operations from embargoed countries or companies currently in CDot.  There are Customer model validations that prevent a sale, pre-transaction.  There is also an ""EmbargoChecker"" service for specific countries (Russia, Belarus) and products (SM).  In both circumstances, the country field on the Customer model is used.  However as we want to embrace using Contact data for the Zuora Account when a Customer converts to paid, this logic will need to be updated.

Provisioning is handled through a few services that process Zuora callouts: [ZuoraCallbackWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb) and [SubscriptionTermStartWorker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/26741557a159d7d6c6a5084fe0fe06aa9aba2a3a/app/workers/zuora_callout/subscription_term_start_worker.rb).  These services have [logic to find or create a customer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/32cde3637e1a9b987a7dcc8f6354168253ad272f/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L24) which currently fail ungracefully when the Sold To Contact/Customer is from a Country on the rejection list due to [this validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/32cde3637e1a9b987a7dcc8f6354168253ad272f/app/models/customer.rb#L51).

### Proposal

In this issue, let's add a redundancy check to these Zuora Callback workers that relate to provisioning to verify the country is not one of the Embargoed List (see below).  This check should validate against the country of the Sold To and Bill To Contact.

* Cuba
* Iran
* Democratic People's Republic of Korea
* Sudan
* Syria

This change can be released without the use of a feature flag as it can be applied independently of other changes mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6053#note_1347043834.

Currently callout workers fail at [this step](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/1bbc5a161bc07335bf46c08b4b2364f3a73c8849/app/workers/zuora_callout/base_worker.rb#L24) where the customer if either created or updated based on callout attributes.

- [Sentry issue](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/4099448/?query=is%3Aunresolved%20country) for the `SubscriptionTermStartWorker`
- [Sentry issue](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/4099799/?query=is%3Aunresolved%20country) for the ZuoraCallbackWorker

We should update these workers with code to verify country.  If it's invalid, the worker could log the event as info or warn, then skip processing the remainder of the worker.  

It's worth noticing that the `AuditProvisionService` will make note that the provision was skipped because of an unsupported country [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/58055f39852434752768d4d7f51cc4d0817871c0/app/services/provisions/audit_provision_service.rb#L56).",3

### Problem
Changes to our gems causes our cache-assets job to fail. We currently have to manually run the `cache-gems-update` job to resolve the failures.

### Proposal
Automate the job so it runs automatically when Gemfile/lock changes are detected.


<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

### Result
No manual intervention is required when gems are updated.

### Next steps (if any)
Also investigate if this is an issue for node dependencies. If so, create an issue to automatically run `cache-node-updates` on changes.

### Problem

In the seat purchase workflow, the customer is provided with a preview of the seat addition before confirming to purchase.

Currently, this uses the `subscription#update` endpoint with `preview: true` to obtain the invoice information.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Create a resolver that can be used to retrieve invoice details to add seats to a subscription.
Since the preview does not make any change to any objects, we do not create a mutation. In order to add seats, the [mutation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5583) will be used.

### Result

The resolver can be used to preview invoice for a seat addition.

126215853,2023-04-04 12:35:04.135,"Manual Legacy License creation does not take custom email, company and name info","### Problem

When creating a custom Legacy License in the Admin (`/admin/license/new_license`), any values entered in the fields for email, company and name won't be reflected in the created license when a subscription ID was entered. This is because those values are always overridden in [these lines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/models/license.rb#L313-315) which are triggered in a [before validation callback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/fdfe35c10eb1b72120f7732d69b19cece0172180/app/models/license.rb#L85).

The [original functionality](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5412) was implemented with a select of a customer on the manual Legacy License creation page. When a customer was selected, this override would kick in and no manual values were accepted in the form.

With the transition away from customers and to billing accounts, this functionality broke because when a subscription is present, the billing account will be present as well and results in triggering the override.

### Proposal

There are (at least) two possible ways to resolve this:

1. Introduce a billing account select in the Legacy License creation form to clearly enforce the override similar to how a select existed for customer in the past ([original MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/5412)). This also means that if no billing account was selected, the entered data from the form has to be used. 
2. Avoid overriding the three values if they were entered into the form.

### Result

126075767,2023-03-31 16:13:58.465,Remove customer memoization related to billing account attrs,"### Summary

Related issue: !6952

Relevant discussion: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6952#note_1332774510

For the `Customer` we memoize the `zuora_account_id` and `salesforce_account_id` values when loaded the first time from the billing account using an instance variable.

Given this memoization can happen in the same request when the associated `billing_accounts` collection for the customer can change + that instance variables are not reloaded on customer reload we end up with the wrong associated values for the entire request (the initial value).

### Porposal

Remove the memoization for `Customer#zuora_account_id` and `Customer#salesforce_account_id`.

Rollout this using the `remove_customer_account_ids_memoization` feature flag (in case we run into a significant slow down in queries). Note we are not expecting for this to impact significantly performance but want to be extra careful. We will leave the flag in place a couple of days and then drop it as part of this same issue.

`components/change_namespace_form_spec.js` tests rely heavily on internal vm methods (such as `wrapper.vm.complete` and unnecessary `waitForPromises`/`nextTick`s. The internal vm behavior can be different between vue2 and vue3, so we should avoid using them. 

### Proposal
Refactor tests in `components/change_namespace_form_spec.js` to no longer use internal vm methods or unnecessary `waitForPromises`/`nextTick`s. This will assist in the Vue3 migration.

125824912,2023-03-27 12:16:39.317,Monitoring of ramps rollout,"## Summary

This is the monitoring issue to make sure that the ramp subscriptions created in production are displayed as expected in the new subscription card design. We need a way to identify ramp subscriptions created in production. Maybe we could check with the sales team on this.  
Keep adding items to the tasks that need to be taken care in the monitoring stage i.e. post rollout of ramp subscriptions in production.

## How to Monitor

Use either of the processes below (not everyone might have access to Data Query). The output from both should be the same.

### Using Zuora Data Query

Use the following steps to check for ramp subscriptions in production:    

1. Login to Zuora production through Okta.
2. Create a new data query - https://www.zuora.com/platform/apps/data-query/queries/new
3. Query to use - `select Subscriptionnumbers, * from orders o inner join ramp r on o.Id = r.OrderId LIMIT 10`.
3. Run query.
4. Copy any 1 subscription number.
4. Search for this subscription number in Zuora subscriptions page - https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?menu=Z-Billing.
4. Copy the corresponding Customer name.
5. Sign in to Customers Portal production as admin user through Okta.
6. Go to `Customers` tab in Customers Portal admin view.
7. Search of the copied customer name.
8. Impersonate the customer as admin to check that the ramp subscription card is shown properly with expected details and subscription management buttons hidden. Can use this [list of scenarios](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5384) to verify if the subscription card shows as expected.
9. Repeat the above steps for 5 customers.


### Using Zuora Report

Additional details in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6129#note_1332193491.

1. Login to Zuora production through Okta.
2. Go to Reports > `Tatyana - Shared` > `Subscriptions with Ramps` > click Run Summary Report (most recently created subscriptions will be at the top).
1. Copy `Sold To: Work Email` or `Account: Name`.
5. Sign in to Customers Portal production as admin user through Okta.
6. Go to `Customers` tab in Customers Portal admin view.
7. Search of the copied customer email or name.
8. Impersonate the customer as admin to check that the ramp subscription card is shown properly with expected details and subscription management buttons hidden. Can use this [list of scenarios](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5384) to verify if the subscription card shows as expected.

# Feature Request

## Problem

Customers are [confused](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/920#note_1316701978) by the wording used in the renewal emails regarding overages:

> ... you may have unpaid seat overages for your instance.

Change the wording to avoid speculation:

> Question on this, is the “skip email confirmation” option only relevant when updating the email address?
The current UI makes it a permanent setting, it seems, for the account. I wonder if it makes more sense to be a one-time option when making an email update?

### Proposal

~~1. Update the UI so it is only displayed when the email is updated.~~ (`rails_admin` is really restrictive about the UI changes it allows it is very difficult to introduce customizations like this.

2. :white_check_mark: Rephrase the checkbox copy to make it clear it applies to an email update.

![image](/uploads/9a92816c107113347dd0d7fdfb9f799c/image.png)

As we are introducing `Bill To` and `Sold To` contact for the customer, we should update the help text to reflect its purpose.

### Proposal

Update help text for Customer account email address to reflect its purpose. This should be made conditional, if a GitLab.com account is connected or not.

#### Connected GitLab.com account:

> This is your Customers Portal account email address and is linked to your GitLab.com account.

### Problem

We're not being consistent in what we show our users. In some places we show cents `41.04` but in other places we round to a whole number. From a brief glance at the code this looks like inconsistent use of the `formatMoney` function.

### Proposal

* Audit usages of `formatMoney` (also looks like we've got components where we only import the function)
* Consistently use 2 decimals - Can possibly be enforced with a helper function

### Result

Consistency in what we display

### Availability and Testing
E2E tests `number_to_currency` options will need to be updated in some places as well. A few key areas to note:
- `qa/page/component/ramp_subscription_card.rb` - remove `precision: 0`, so that whole prices will have .00 for cents
- `qa/vendor/gitlab/page/component/order_summary.rb` - remove `strip_insignificant_zeros: true`, so that trailing zeros are not stripped",2

### Problem

When errors are matched using strings, they are quite fragile to changes in the backend and string mismatches. An example of this is when the `{""email"": [""has already been taken""]}` error was translated to the [description here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330608#initial-problem) with a different character, leaving the error handled sub-optimally.

1. [Data backfill for existing `BillingAccount` objects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6068)

### Proposal

This issue tracks effort related to the creation of the `BillingAccountContact` model. This model will hold `Zuora::Contact` data as well as the `zuora_contact_id` related to the object we want to save.

A `BillingAccountContact` object will ultimately be the SSOT for customer contact details, which means that contact detail fields in `Customer` should also be present in `BillingAccountContact` (we may want to be consistent with the new Presenter introduced via [this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6838)). 

`BillingAccountContact` objects will only be created to hold Bill to and Sold to contact data, given a `BillingAccount` object. This means that `BillingAccount#sold_to` and `BillingAccount#bill_to` references will have to be added: this mimics the architecture behind `Zuora::Account` (ie. access of these contact objects via `zuora_account.bill_to` and `zuora_account.sold_to`, even if they are the same object (which is often the case))

Work on this issue should not be about implementation.

125544296,2023-03-20 16:15:50.085,Validate assumptions about Compliance in CustomersDot,"### Background

The ~""group::fulfillment platform"" team is looking to improve contact management in CustomersDot as part of https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9831+.  In this epic we will be introducing the concept of BillingAccount Contacts to CDot which will store data about the Bill To and Sold To Contacts for a BillingAccount.  More details can be found in this [proposal doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/contacts_management_proposal.md).  This new concept will have an impact on Compliance in CustomersDot.

Compliance is performed in CDot in a few different ways at the moment:

1. Visual Compliance (Sanctions Screening Tool)
    - This tool screens purchaser information (name, country, and state (for USA/CAN purchasers only) against various sanctions and denied party lists, supplied from SFDC and creates an export hold in SFDC when a) a potential match is detected and/or b) for purchases originating from high risk countries. This screening occurs when an opportunity or quote is created in SFDC. 
    - This tool was briefly enabled in CDot in 2021 and then disabled because it blocked more purchases than expected (unnecessarily). For this reason, web direct purchasers are currently only screened post-purchase. 
    - Visual Compliance will be replaced by a new tool, Navex Risk Rate, in April 2023 in SFDC. Visual Compliance will be retired shortly thereafter. We plan to subsequently enable Risk Rate or an equivalent for web direct purchases, however, the plan is not yet defined. In the meantime, Risk Rate will screen these purchasers, post purchase as Visual Compliance does currently. 
    -   See [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4857) to remove Visual Compliance for non-Marketplace usage.
2. EmbargoChecker service
    - An internal control implemented per [Issue 4166](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4166), the [`EmbargoChecker`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/43b599e2dc1d52d074d97da549167c2b44a8bf69/lib/embargo_checker.rb) verifies if a Customer's country or IP location is Russia or Belarus before allowing important actions, like updating or renewing a Subscription. 
    - This control ensures compliance with trade control laws implemented in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It, for example, prevents the customer's independent renewal of self-managed subscriptions, which are in most cases prohibited by export control law; and allows Legal an opportunity to identify, on a case-by-case basis, exceptions to that general prohibition, to screen individual customers in Visual Compliance/Risk Rate pre-purchase, and to screen the purchasers' paying bank (many of which have been sanctioned).  
    - Note: the Embargo Checker is country-based and does not consider whether any given purchaser is identified on a sanctions list. 
3. Country validations on Customer record
    - This validates the `country` field for a Customer record is not included in a hard-coded list, [`World::COUNTRIES_TO_REJECT`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f628a9a0ffc0d6a99181684bab3c417eb671d1a7/lib/world.rb#L32).

As seen above, the Customer record is used heavily for compliance, but as we introduce Sold To Contacts into CDot, this seems like the more appropriate object to use for Compliance checks.

### Questions

Before going to far down ~""workflow::solution validation"", we'd have some questions for ~""group::compliance"".

1. Thinking about the sales-assisted flow, if SFDC / Zuora have customer data for embargoed countries/companies, and sends a callout to CDot for provisioning, should it be allowed?
    - For example, if CDot receives a callout where the SoldTo contact has a country of China, should CDot continue with provisioning access?
2. What entity should be considered when thinking about compliance?
    - Is it the individual that’s logged in (Customer) or the BillingAccount they belong to (SoldTo)?
    - How is this done in SFDC? Is it based on Account address? SoldTo Address?
3. What is the latest plan for RiskRate?
    - Status update?
    - How do we plan to use it for information generated via CDot (i.e. web direct flows)?

### Results

Once we have answers to these questions, we can confidently update the [contacts management proposal doc](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/architecture/contacts_management_proposal.md) and create more issues for https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9831.",2

## Problem

Offline Cloud License customers are seeing upcoming QSR banners in their instance, while not being on QSR or not necessarily having exceeded their seat count.

The work for QSR's for Offline customers has not yet been completed by ~""group::billing and subscription management"" (see [related epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7471)). However, we recently became aware that SM customers on an Offline license are seeing QSR upcoming banners.

~""group::provision"" [setup a banner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3355) a year back for Offline customers notifying them of an upcoming QSR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3355/designs/Automated_license_file_quaterly_reconciliation_alerts.png

These are shown 14 days prior, 7 days prior and 1 day after the reconciliation due date. These were established with the assumption of QSR support for offline customers.

However, the banner text states `You have more active users than your license allows for. (or than are allowed by your license.) Before \*\*date\*\* you must get reconciled? GitLab must reconcile your subscription/license?` - without ever having any awareness if the user has *actually* exceeded their seat count.

## Proposal
Update the banner logic to only display if `turn_on_seat_reconciliation__c` is `Yes` - otherwise this should not be shown.",1

125104403,2023-03-10 14:31:55.799,Updating Customer Email as an Admin user,"# Bug

## Summary

There are times when Support team need to update a customersDot email address per request of the customer, or in order to send a license file to the intended recipient after [a Zuora contact change took place](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/383199) that the customer was not expecting (e.g. separate subscription closed won).  This is relevant even for creating/sending legacy licenses since they will pull Zuora contact info regardless of the email address entered into the form.

In the past, [this was a simple update/save](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/customersdot/associating_purchases.html#process).  Now, with some recent changes to the platform, its require the email addresses to be confirmed by the customer, even when changed through admin actions, and it creates kind of an undesirable scenario for both us and the customer.  We should be able to circumvent this from the admin side.

For one, cdot sends 2 emails out per change, an ""FYI this happened"" and a ""please confirm this happened"".  That's fine in a vacuum, but it may unintentionally be spamming the customer, especially if the email address is being changed only temporarily.  For two, it breaks our workflow to ""Change the email in the new account for example: person@example.com to person_edited@example.com""; `person_edited` is not a real address and therefore can't get the confirmation email, but that's sort of the point with that workflow to swap addresses around.

Also, I notice it updates Zuora BTST immediately, even when cdot still reflects the previous email address.  That may or may not be intentional?

## What is the expected *correct* behavior?

From the admin side, we should be able to update contact information without relying on the customer to confirm their address.  Or, we should have the means to confirm it for them without email.  In a perfect world, we should never need to change cdot contact info for them, but there are many relevant reasons for why support needs to change cdot info on behalf of the customer

## Workarounds

In some cases, you can change the email to update Zuora, send the license, then update it back in cdot.  This does probably spam the customer with multiple notifications that the address has been changed.

### Problem

When using Amend API to perform a renewal operation, each type resulted in a separate amendment. For e.g. when upgrading a subscription, multiple amendments to Renew, Add product and Remove product will be generated. The latest version of the subscription may or may not be the Renewal amendment. Thus, when Zuora triggered a callback, the `amendment_types` attribute may or may not include `RenewSubscription`.

To circumvent this limitation, the method `Subscription#recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments` was introduced to check if any of the amendments associated with the last transaction subscription included a `Renewal`.

The method is used when sending [online cloud notification](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/services/online_cloud_license_notification_service.rb#L14) email. Now that all renewals occur using Orders API, the first condition `renewal_amendment` should return `true` when the transaction included a Rewewal- as [`amendment_types` callback attribute](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L47) includes all [order action types translated into respective amendment types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/workers/zuora_callout/order_processed_worker.rb#L41).

Consequently, the `Subscription#recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments` method should be ready to cleanup.

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

Before dropping the method, confirm the method is no longer being used:

- [x] Add a logger in the [`recently_renewed_with_multiple_amendments?` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/ea526eded21642fd041170da5a53fe2f61f6425e/app/models/subscription.rb#L618) to ensure the code path does not reach the point when `base_subscription_id` is returned. This will confirm Amend API is not used for any of the existing workflows where the cloud notification is sent
- [x] Verify for all Renewal use cases `OnlineCloudLicenseNotificationService#execute` sends appropriate email (see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5944#note_1313873775)

- [x] Once above two verification is complete, the method can be dropped (and inclusion of logger module).

### Result

Cleanup of unused code.

### Problem
Given the [backfill completed that generated activation codes for all remaining customers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5604), any customer with customer portal access should be able to self-activate with cloud licensing. Because cloud licensing does not have any legal terms component, there is no reason to have a condition on whether or not to display the activation code based on if the customer is super sonics aware or not.

### Proposal
Remove the `super_sonics_aware` check for the different displays of legacy license / activation codes in the customer portal.

Related code is here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/f628a9a0ffc0d6a99181684bab3c417eb671d1a7/app/presenters/subscription_presenter.rb#L213

### Problem
When viewing `Licenses` in CustomersDot Admin, you can sort licenses by type of Cloud, Offline Cloud, Legacy Licenses & Trial. However, when I click on the `Show` button to view details of an individual license, I can't see from that view the license type. It would be helpful to have this so when I look at an individual license, I can easily identify the type.

![image](/uploads/679b02d3e96e240d8616980fc0ed881c/image.png)

### Proposal


Add a field that tracks type of license in this screen:

![image](/uploads/6a3d5cb8aef73ce1a23a901d1548c194/image.png)

It could also be useful to add this as a column in the `List of Licenses` view if possible.

### Result
From the detail license view, I can tell what license type it is.

124718481,2023-03-04 00:43:04.551,Consider disable/hide the production Marketplace openapi doc page,"ATM the Marketplace openapi doc page is available on all environments:
- https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace
- https://customers.staging.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace
- http://localhost:5000

Should we consider to hide this page on production server(https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace)?
- For openapi doc purpose, staging server is enough for people to understand and try/play with the APIs
- I think we do not expect anyone will play those APIs on production server. 
   - It is dangerous. If people `place order` from the production page, it does **not** go through Marketplace partner's system. there is no history on partner's system to audit -- which is not expected I think. 
   - It does not bring too much convenience either. People needs to have Marketplace partner's **production client_id/client_secret** to be able to try the APIs on production page https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace. 
      - For GitLab developers, if for issue investigation, we would directly get that data from DB, rather than `get client_id/client_secret from DB, and then go back to the web page to try`.

So, the proposal is, hide the production page https://customers.gitlab.com/openapi_docs/marketplace. It is only available on non-production environmebnt(staging, localhost, stag-ref)
   - another option is: disable `try it out` feature on production. -- I do not prefer this option, because: unless we have an easier way to switch it off, it may require us to maintain a separate copy of [marketplace_openapi.yaml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/doc/api/marketplace_openapi.yaml)

As noted in the thread above, there are a couple of refactoring improvements that can be done in the SalesForce object / opportunity creation workflow:

- [x] Pass `order_number` when creating SalesForce objects in the new subscription workflow. This will result in the [`handle_with_zuora_order` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/7c69ad620b411f58fe3d1370fba65f6826c15439/app/services/salesforce/create_quote_objects_service.rb#L59) to be invoked. As it already invokes the `handle_new_subscription` method if `CreateSubscription` order action is present, the objects should be created as expected. MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6696
- [x] remove method #handle_existing_subscription and #create_objects_for_existing_subscription in favor of #handle_with_zuora_order in Salesforce::CreateQuoteObjectsService (MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6721) 

**Parameter changes**:

- [x] `amendments` parameter can be dropped as well as Orders API does not pass `amendments`.  (MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/6721) 
- [ ] ~~`order_number` is currently an optional parameter. We can make it mandatory param similar to `subscription_name`, `invoice_id` by moving it up in the param list. The default value of `nil` could be misleading. This should help in contributing towards https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4994 to a slight extent :slight_smile:~~ See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/5862#note_1302778650",3

* [x] [Upgrade @vue/test-utils to 1.x version](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4255)
  * **Why?** Our current version is more than one year old. It has multiple annoying bugs fixed in current version. Additionally new version contains significant deprecations (which leads to higher quality tests) and important runtime validations (for example, operating on destroyed wrappers will throw warnings)
  * **How?** Fix failing tests and VTU itself
* [x] [Act on each kind of deprecations in @vue/test-utils 1.x](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3856)
  * **Why?** Each deprecation is road blocker for upgrade to Vue3. Most of deprecations are bad code smells
  * **How?** See relevant epic for details. Some of deprecations are just ""find & replace"" things, some (like usage of `methods` and `setMethods`) requires significant specs refactoring
* [ ] Cleanup codebase based on new VTU features (epic TBD)
  * **Why?** Improve and simplify our test suite. Get rid of that `nextTick`!
  * **How?** Search and destroy. Some of these things could be done with codemod
  - [ ] Remove excessive `nextTick` calls. `trigger`, `setProps`, etc. now return `nextTick` inside, so they could be just awaited
  - [ ] Remove useless stubs. VTU now renders all slots by default, so some stubs could be removed
* [ ] Remove `localVue` usage - [Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/6058)
  * **Why?** `localVue` is one of the most confusing feature in `@vue/test-utils` and [we do not need it at all](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220482)
  * **How?** 95% of this action could be done via code mod + [we have MR pending with fix](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/47729)
* [x] [Convert remaining tests from our legacy `mountComponent` / `mountComponentWithStore` helpers to `@vue/test-utils`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5110)
  * **Why?** `@vue/test-utils` is official supported way of testing components
  * **How?** Rewrite each test manually :cry: 
* [ ] [Clean unnecessary 'Vue.extend' uses in Jest tests](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2418)
  * **Why?** It is simply not needed and adds additional complexity and slowness to our test suite
  * **How?** Most of these could be removed with codemod
* [x] Unify our `nextTick` usage
  * **Why?** See [RFC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/rfcs/-/issues/47) for rationale
  * **How?** Most of these could be done with codemod
* [ ] Switch to `async` / `await`
  * **Why?** See excellent [RFC by @rkuba](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/rfcs/-/issues/45) for details 
  * **How?** Some of these could be implemented with codemod
* [ ] [Remove direct modification of Vue instances](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5105)
  * **Why?** Modifying internal instance state makes test fragile and leaks implementation details to the test
  * **How?** Each case should be approached individually :cry: 
* [ ] [Remove spying on Vue components methods](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5106)
  * **Why?** Modifying internal instance behavior decreases test value and leaks implementation details to the test
  * **How?** Each case should be approached individually :cry:
* [ ] Implement eslint rules to prevent most annoying issues
  * **Why?** Everything what could be automated should be automated
  * [ ] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/issues/12
  * [x] [mountHelper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/frontend/eslint-plugin/-/issues/9)
* [ ] Update docs to reflect recent changes
* [x] [Simplify our tests with `enableAutoDestroy`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8915)

### Problem

When a subscription is renewed based on EoA starter / bronze offer terms, the [description in the amendment record](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L162) is set to `'EoA Bronze / Starter Price Uplift'`. With the transition to Orders API, this description was set in the charge overrides, accessible in Rate plan charge record (source: [`AddProduct`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/add_product.rb#L73), [`UpdateProduct`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/zuora/orders/actions/param_constructor/update_product.rb#L28) order actions)

However, while calculating the renewal price, we use the [count of amendments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/e88993e6fa567f72e1eb5207be0a87954f16cc5c/app/services/eoa_starter_bronze/offer_renewals_count_service.rb#L14) that have description set to `'EoA Bronze / Starter Price Uplift'`. It does not account for the charge overrides, which can result in a lower count and thereby returning the lower tier price.

This should likely not have an impact as of now, as we transitioned to Orders API for renewals on [January 19th](use_orders_api_subscription_update_workflow). For all EoA starter / bronze renewals following it, the count of description in amendment records represent the correct count. The charge overrides description will become relevant when the subscriptions are renewed the next time (i.e. the following year).

Spot checked a few subscriptions in production:

- [A-S00014461](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a12881086832d1e0186a19b26c312a2) (related renewal [Order](https://www.zuora.com/orders#/view/O-00100142))
- [A-S00008155](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a12827c86832d1d01869ed74c622ff7) (related renewal [Order](https://www.zuora.com/orders#/view/O-00103234)) 
- [A-S00038277](https://www.zuora.com/apps/Subscription.do?method=view&id=8a12827c86832d1d0186990541d41535) (related renewal [Order](https://www.zuora.com/orders#/view/O-00094065))

### Proposal

<!-- Consult with `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/zuora-architects` on the ~""Enterprise Applications"" team if Zuora business logic is involved. -->

When calculating the next renewal price for EoA starter / bronze subscriptions, use Amendment description **and** charge overrides description. 

### Result

EoA step price is calculated accurately.

While an error is raised, the service is still sending out the emails to the customer. But if a reseller email has to be sent it would fail.

### Proposal

Return early in the skip notification check when the subscription is for an Online Cloud subscription.

### Result

Fix the exception and allow reseller emails to be sent.",1
124119042,2023-02-22 11:00:50.361,Work with tracking locally without manually updating code to point to port,"### Problem

Currently to debug local tracking we need to manually update [tracking.rb#L93](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/lib/gitlab/tracking.rb#L93) to point it to port `9090`. This is the port for [snowplow-micro](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/snowplow-micro-configuration) that we use for local test configuration.

### Proposal

Introduce a condition that would check `Rails.env.development?` and set `SnowplowTracker::AsyncEmitter.new('localhost:9090', protocol: 'http')` if it's a dev environment.

Update existing docs -> remove the manual step from it.

### Proposal

|BE| - | Transaction has failed **Note:** we don't have a try/catch around this action, we might need to add it to catch this failure | SubscriptionsController | `transaction_failed` |

#### Resume subscription

For all the tracking events set `event_label` as `resume_subscription_sm` / `resume_subscription_saas`

**Attention:** There is extra confirmation, the click on the button on the card is the only FE event

| FE/BE | Page | Description | Event category | Event action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |  ------ | ------ |

### Problem

We don't have nice and convenient way of getting corrects Rails routes on front-end side or in a Vue application.

### Proposal

Let's investigate possible usage of this gem - [JsRoutes](https://github.com/railsware/js-routes/issues/237)

Consider the simple Vue application that should send a request to the API endpoint `/countries`.  What are our options here to provide the correct route to this Vue application?

**First option: use `data-` attributes from HAML**

```haml
#js-app{ data: { country_end_point: countries_url } }
```

**Pros:**

* We pass the correct URL to the application;
* Changes on the backend will propagate to front-end without making changes to front-end

**Cons:**

* Additional property for the Vue application.

**Second option: `gon` gem**

```ruby
gon.routes = {
  countries_url: countries_url
}
```

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'JsApp',
  methods: {
    fetchCountries() {
      axios.get(gon.routes.countries_url);
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**

* We have the correct URL;
* We don't need to create an extra property in the Vue application;
* Changes on the backend will propagate to front-end without making changes to front-end

**Cons:**

* We have to manually add a new route to `gon`;
* We make our component ""too smart"" due to accessing the `gon` inside of it,

**Third option: JsRoutes gem**

```ruby
gon.routes = JsRoute.generate
```

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'JsApp',
  methods: {
    fetchCountries() {
      axios.get(gon.routes.countries_url);
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**

* We have the correct URL;
* We don't need to create an extra property in the Vue application;
* Changing the route on the backend doesn't affect the front-end.

**Cons:**

* Extra gem in our `Gemfile`;
* Possible exposing of protected routes.

### Problem
We're loading Sentry from a CDN https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/staging/app%2Fviews%2Fshared%2F_sentry_js_lib.html.haml and exposing it on a global level.

That means that manually calling `captureException` for example in [`payment_methods_plugin`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/staging/app/assets/javascripts/payment_methods_plugin.js#L90) reaches for a global `Sentry`.

Since Sentry is not active in local development, this causes an `undefined` error, which hides what the underlying error actually was.

### Proposal
Package Sentry in an NPM package and ensure it does not break local development.

Not breaking local development is built-in to Sentry, so if we follow the documented setup route; we should be fine.

28031362,2019-12-06 18:05:51.258,Update frontend packages regularly,"We had a meeting with @leipert about when and how often the project's dependencies should be updated.

The [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_xKVL37ao3RAb2N-L7RiYeTIUnSRLmw4eeHSxOWh44/edit) contains drawbacks, benefits and concerns about this topic.

What @leipert suggested we do is to start with gitlab's packages (`@gitlab/ui` and `@gitlab/svgs`) and enable renovate bot to send MRs.

It could start smaller and safer by enabling the bot to update some of the devDependencies like eslint and all related packages, if all went smoothly for couple weeks then we can increase the volume of the packages being updated regularly.

### Proposal

Setup renovate bot to start sending MRs about updated packages.

### Result

Relatively up to date packages, with smaller changes at a time.

### Problem

We have a special condition for hiding some menu items in the navigation bar. If a customer has at least one purchase we show the menu item `Manage purchases` otherwise it's hidden. Right now we have [a special method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/staging/app/controllers/application_controller.rb#L50) for checking that condition. The problem is this method makes HTTP requests to Zuora for getting the list of subscriptions. And we do that every time we load our navigation bar.

You can test it locally by adding `httplog` gem to your `Gemfile` then go any page and start refreshing the page.

### Proposal

Create a special column for the Customer for indicating existing subscriptions for a customer.

### Result

Decreasing the amount of requests to Zuora and improved page load.

Right now we are using Rails controllers to add API endpoints, missing out on features like versioning and making it more difficult if we were to expand this API.

### Proposal

Discuss whether we want to use [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape), [GraphQL](https://graphql-ruby.org/), or another library.

My understanding is that we are moving towards GraphQL on GitLab, but we should choose the best that fit our needs regardless.

We should then create a separate issue to discuss whether we want to migrate existing endpoints.

### Summary

We get a large amount of these errors in Sentry and we should investigate it and fix it: https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/810657 

@rdavila Believes it is related to worker SyncGitlabGroupMemberWorker, which is used to update Salesforce when a user is added so that Support can understand what level of support to provide to a user.

### Steps

- [x] Delete the system hook(s) that points to `https://customers.gitlab.com/gitlab_system_hook` from `GL.com`
- [x] Drop logic related to `SyncGitlabGroupMemberWorker` from customers (routes / controllers / job)
- [x] Clean up of other changes that were introduced to allow the dropped logic (this will simplify the code)
- [x] Submit a MR to the cookbooks to remove the generation of the constant: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/cookbook-customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/104
- [x] Create an issue for infrastructure to drop the value: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/11569",2

### Problem

All guidelines, caveats or tips that we follow are not documented in a single place, people contributing to this project are not aware of it, and it doesn't exist to serve as a reference.

### Proposal

Add all guidelines, caveats or tips that we follow to `doc/frontend.md`.

### Problem

We don't have E2E tests for sign in. That's why we encountered #857 during manual testing. We should catch these errors during automatic tests (`rspec`). Adding these tests will also cover the integration layer between the Browser and the Web Server, things like CSRF token.

### Problem

Raised in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/722#note_246967622

We're currently using `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements = false` in our feature specs, in large part because we're asserting `hidden` loading spinners are not active.

This leads to non-obvious failures like https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/853

Since feature specs are E2E and should assert on what the user can see and interact with; we should only be working with visible and interactable DOM elements.

### Proposal

Set a global `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements = true` and fix any specs that are affected by this.

### Result

Feature specs more closely resemble how a user interacts with the customer portal.

### Problem
The iron bank gem does not provide an out of box solution to delete records.

For e.g. previously with the `active_zuora` gem, an account could be updated as follows:

```ruby
account = customer.zuora_account
account.delete
```

This, is however, not possible with the Iron bank gem.

It provides `update`, `delete` and similar other CRUD classes to perform these operations: https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/tree/master/lib/iron_bank/actions

### Proposal
Add a `delete` method to delete records, that would internally invoke Iron Bank's `delete` api.

### Result


### Next steps (if any)
Consider moving the `delete` method to the iron bank gem.

26991409,2019-11-12 18:49:01.167,Exclude VCR cassettes from Danger bot,"### Problem
When Danger bot does it's evaluation of changes in an MR, VCR cassette changes are factored into the warning about if a MR is too large.  This can totally skew the perception of the MR being too large and can make the warning useless for any MR that includes VCR changes.

![Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_1.42.38_PM](/uploads/592c95b25c9f8813a72a6353f8c0364b/Screen_Shot_2019-11-12_at_1.42.38_PM.png)

### Proposal
We should update Danger bot to exclude VCR cassettes from this warning.  VCR cassette changes aren't generally a concern as we can/should re-record cassettes commonly.  These can largely be ignored by the reviewer.

### Result
Improved stats regarding MR size.

### Problem

Currently when you update a subscription you’re taken to a page that looks the same as the index, but some of your subscriptions go away.. like, toggle the auto-renew and boom, all your subscriptions go away except the one that you just clicked a toggle button on.

This is done to have the user focus in on the subscription that changed, but the `this page look an awful lot like where I was, where did my other subscriptions go?` feeling is hard to shake.

_Note that this is a dev account. Most users won't have this many subscriptions_

### Problem

Current stages for CI pipelines take ~10 minutes to finish, most of that time will be spent on installing dependencies.

### Proposal

Add stage for building a docker image as a base image for running all other stages, so the stages won't need to install any dependencies and can start the actual job immediately.

### Result

- Faster CI run time => faster feedback on the MR.
- A step toward auto devops.

### Next steps (if any)

* [ ] Schedule the issue.

  * Checkbox: Field: I am Tax or VAT exempt (true/false), if marked true, then show the next field values:
    * Show them their ID on file: then they select:
        - ""Use ID on file"" or ""My ID has changed"", if they choose ""I have a new ID"" then show a dependent field:
            * Company Country of Origin: If EU country, we show field ""VAT ID"" (Account.taxinfo.VATid (objectified)) and we run a check on their VAT ID; if anything else, we show field ""Tax ID"" (Account.taxinfo.TaxExemptCertificateID (objectified))
* New Customers
  * Checkbox: Field: I have a Tax or VAT ID (true/false), if marked true, then show:
    * Company Country of Origin: If EU country, we show field ""VAT ID"" (Account.taxinfo.VATid (objectified)) and we run a check on their VAT ID; if anything else, we show field ""Tax ID"" (Account.taxinfo.TaxExemptCertificateID (objectified))

### Result:
GitLab has the proper documentation to comply with tax regulation.

### Problem

For PCI compliance purposes, we need to have a 90 password expiration for `customers.gitlab.com` on all team member accounts. **This shouldn't be applied to customer user accounts, only GitLab team member accounts.** This would remediate a [compliance gap](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/498) we found during our gap analysis project.

Please see the exchange below [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/498#note_219082240) for more context.

### Proposal

Add 90 day password experiation for all GitLab team member accounts on or that provide access to the data of `customers.gitlab.com` (e.g., accounts on the app itself, database accounts, etc). After those 90 days, the password cannot be used to log in and must be changed.

### Problem
Couple of api calls made from subscription portal to GL.com use the admin token.

I'm thinking about moving all the javascript code in an MR from `app/assets/javascript` to `app/javascript` so all JS will be in one folder instead of being spread on 2 folders.

@vitallium suggested that if we are going to do that the better name will be `app/frontend` because we will add styles there too. But I like the idea of moving JS from `app/assets`.

Do you mind combining everything related to the frontend (JS, Sass, tests) including webpacker's entry points `app/javascript/pack` under one `app/frontend` folder?

We have an unfortunately named class `.plan-info-panel` in `subscription_upgrades/_plan.html.haml`.

### Problem
Currently we need to manually add vendor specific prefixes https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/merge_requests/558#note_232562193

Instead we should use [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)

### Proposal
~~Investigate whether it makes sense to add `autoprefixer` via Gems or NPM dependency (serve it directly to `webpacker`)~~

### Problem
We're seeing errors in `onSubscriptionError` like [this Sentry error report](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/234458/?query=cannot%20read) and [this](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/customersgitlabcom/issues/1000451/?query=cannot%20read)

Looking at the function nothing seems off at first glance.

```
// subscription_form.js
function onSubscriptonError(errors) {
  if (errors.attributes && errors.attributes.indexOf('coupon') >= 0) {
    $('#coupon-error').text('Invalid code');
  } else {
    ZuoraSubscriptionErrorHandler.redirectToErrorPage(errors);
  }
}

````

This fatal error is occurring because `onSubscriptonError` (I also just noticed there's a typo there) is being called with with an `undefined` object.

This happens in the callback here
```
// subscription_form.js
ZuoraSubscription.update(data, result => {
    if (result.success) {
      on_success(result);
    } else {
      onSubscriptonError(result.errors);
    }

    window.scrollTo(0, 0);

    // Whatever the response is always enable the submit button
    $('#preview-subscription').removeAttr('disabled');
  });
```

#### What does the user see?
The user just sees the loading page spinning without resolving

#### How should we have noticed this?
- Look at Sentry error reports; however [this isn't part of our workflow](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/issues/714)
- Have tests in place for this scenario
- Use static types to catch these problems; *If static type checking was in place the computer would catch this error before we'd ship this piece of code*

### Proposal
A patch here is to ensure we're not passing `undefined` to `onSubscriptonError`
```
onSubscriptonError(result.errors || {code: 500, message: 'Unknown error occurred, this has been logged in our service; Please open a Support ticket if the problem persists' });
```

The more serious problem is that we didn't catch this sooner.
We should
- Incorporate Sentry into our workflow (all fulfillment engineers should have Sentry notifications on? Open tickets automatically for new error reports?)
- Increase our test coverage
- Seriously consider adopting something like TypeScript",2

(How one can reproduce the issue - this is very important)

1. Add new payment method
1. Navigate to `/plans`
1. Add pick a plan
1. (select number of users) and click Proceed to checkout
1. On the billing information block click 'add a new form of payment' radio

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Clicking 'add a new form of payment' does not show the credit cards iframe for adding new payment method.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Clicking 'add a new form of payment' should show the credit cards iframe for adding new payment method.

25983233,2019-10-16 04:50:13.641,[Frontend] extract zuora events from payment_method template,"### Problem

When we move our JS from sprockets to webpacker, all classes will not be accessible from outside (i.e. not added to global scope).

`app/views/zuora_callbacks/payment_method.html.haml` has inline JS that depends on JS classes that will not exist in the global scope, and its functionality will break once we move the JS to webpacker.

### Problem
The REST API base url for Zuora we have in code: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/staging/lib/zuora/rest_client.rb#L7 is different than what's mentioned in Zuora documentation: https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Introduction/Access-to-the-API. It's probably an old url and Zuora has deprecated it by now (could not find reference docs).

The old url probably still works (used in Receipts and Digital Signature), but would be good to update to the latest ones.

Also, Zuora recommendeds to use API token as a way to authenticate. Currently, we use the legacy way of `apiAccessKeyId` and `apiSecretAccessKey` to authenticate: https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/Other-Supported-Authentication-Schemes

93082739,2021-09-03 14:31:28.685,Add feature flag for processing orders callouts,"### Background

To get [Zuora Orders Harmonization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6641) working in CustomersDot, there are many things to still sort out.  We've found that with Orders Harmonization enabled in Zuora, when using the Amend API to modify subscriptions, CustomersDot can receive multiple callouts to the `subscription_update` endpoint.  This is because with Order Action Processed callouts configured alongside the Amendment Processed callouts, both will be triggered in Zuora.  When the Order feature is used, only the Order Action callout will be triggered.

It seems likely that we will need a feature flag for Orders Harmonization.  This will serve as an indicator to know which callouts to process.

### Proposal

Introduce a feature flag, `orders_harmonization`, which will server as an indication of which callouts to process.  With the flag enabled, CustomersDot should process Orders-related callouts.  If disabled, CustomersDot should process the existing amendment-related callouts.

To distinguish Orders-related callouts from amendments-related callouts, we could check the callout body params for `order_id`.  We're not exactly sure at this moment what type of callout will be used for orders (see [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/322#note_666782612) for more info), but it seems like whether we go with order processed or order action processed, either one should contain an `order_id`.

### Result

Feature flag created: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/104/edit",1
93027345,2021-09-02 18:10:02.653,Remove amendment from Product object,"## Background

When using the Amend API to make changes to a subscription, the Subscription Rate Plan ends up with a reference to the `amendment_id` responsible for the change. As part of the [Orders Harmonization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6641) testing, we noticed when using Orders to make changes to a subscription, there is no `amendment_id` on the Subscription Rate Plan (interestingly there is an `amendment_type`).

CustomersDot uses this reference to the `amendment_id` in order to build a `Product` object ([ref](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/ac33b9df3ddfd21f27eaad5e452d86394ecb7384/app/models/product.rb#L22)) for the subscription (think of this as an object representing the products attached to the subscription). 

As far as we can tell, the amendment on the Product is used only to determine [the ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/ac33b9df3ddfd21f27eaad5e452d86394ecb7384/app/models/product.rb#L52)`created_at` datetime of the Product. CustomersDot is using the `created_date` of the amendment as the Product's `created_at` date. It's not exactly clear why this is using the amendment, but was introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/333 over 2 years ago. Perhaps this information could be pulled from the Subscription Rate Plan, Charge or Tier, and eliminate this dependency on the amendment.

## Purpose

Investigate if `amendment` can be removed from [the `Product` model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/ac33b9df3ddfd21f27eaad5e452d86394ecb7384/app/models/product.rb#L22).  It appears to only be used for [the `created_at` method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/ac33b9df3ddfd21f27eaad5e452d86394ecb7384/app/models/product.rb#L52) (but we should confirm that).  If we use other object like the Subscription Rate Plan, Charge or Tier to get a ""created"" timestamp of the product, we would be able to remove amendment.

We also noticed that the [amendment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/937b0ca6dd146c43fb21a5d8bff356824e052bd9/app/models/subscription.rb#L72) in the subscription object appears to be only used for product initialization. We should determine if it can be removed from Subscription as well.",2

92961922,2021-09-01 22:11:36.686,[Documentation] CustomersDot <> Zuora Object Mapping,"### Problem

We need a way to understand how Zuora objects are mapped in CustomersDot.  This helps solve several business and technical challenges.  For one, this helps when analyzing impact of a change.  It helps in describing scope of a required change.  It can also help with communicating the state of a subscription resulting from an order/account update.

### Proposal

Create information oriented documentation that describes and maps Zuora object fields to fields in CustomersDot.  At the very least, the documentation includes:

- list of fields in CustomersDot and the corresponding field it maps to in Zuora
- each field is fully qualified and specifies the source, table name and field name (ie: Source, TABLE_NAME.FIELD_NAME )
- each field describes when they are initialized, and possibly subsequent updates, if appropriate

92644434,2021-08-26 14:14:11.722,Update activated_at when activate request received for a previously activated instance,"### Problem

As discussed in [this discussion thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337531#note_661936602), an instance could fluctuate between the type of license used for their subscription.  They could start with a license file, then use a cloud license, back to a license file, and so on.  When a customer activates an instance for the first time, [the `activated_at` timestamp is set to the current datetime](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e32106e55ef97492032ef0e8789119f637ed3272/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L61).  However, if the instance had previously been activated (IOW. a `SelfManagedInstanceActivation` already exists for the `activation_code` and `instance_identifier`, the `activated_at` isn't updated but it probably should be since the instance is activating again.

### Proposal

In [the `ActivateService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/e32106e55ef97492032ef0e8789119f637ed3272/app/services/cloud_activations/activate_service.rb#L19), update the `activated_at` timestamp to the current time if the `self_managed_instance_activation` record already exists.  Also, make sure the new license generated after the `activated_at` is updated contains this change so that when synced to the instance the ""Activated On"" reflects the current time.

### Problem

For some reason we use `Sentry.captureMessage` for capturing exceptions and that leads to several problems:

- Unhelpful messages in out status channel in Slack. See the image below.
- `captureMessage` automatically assigns the `info` level to the message which breaks the error statistic because `captureException` sets the level to `fatal`.

After a license expires, the GitLab instance becomes blocked and git features like pushes are blocked. Here's a link to the docs on this: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/license.html#what-happens-when-your-license-expires.

This issue is to design/investigate the removal of a cloud license. [Original discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3215#note_595998053).

## Proposal

- Add a remove license button to the Admin > Subscription page for cloud licenses
- Follow the same removal flow as legacy licenses

We should be able to reuse the same endpoint for deleting legacy licenses, [`LicensesController#destroy`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/a90ec139423285cd8046a6373603c4b79d85e46d/ee/app/controllers/admin/licenses_controller.rb#L37).

92520374,2021-08-24 18:10:30.325,New Trials Report as Free Plan in CustomersDot Backend,"### Problem

A trial plan using one of the new `ultimate_trial` plans appears as a `free` plan in the CustomersDot admin backend.

However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps our product team validate the problem and start working on a solution. -->

### Problem to solve

The ability to manually renew a subscription is only available starting 15 days prior to the expiration date of the subscription.

Currently, the renew button is disabled until 15 days before the expriration date with a tool tip explaining when the customer will be able to renew.

![Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_4.59.23_PM](/uploads/06d9ecd6f1b61cde47a2875103b60a83/Screen_Shot_2022-11-30_at_4.59.23_PM.png)

This has proven to be a confusing experience for customers because they often do not see the tooltip.

Additionally, customer sometimes try to find a way to pay true-ups without knowing that the true-up is paid at the same time as renewal.

### Intended users

Subscription owners/managers in CDot

### User experience goal

Customer know when they can renew and what they can do when they click the `Renew` button once it's available.

### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/journeys/#user-journey -->

Keep the renew button active at all times, regardless of whether or not the customer has the ability to renew. 

If the ability to renew is not available when they click the `Renew` button, show a modal explaining the renewal window and that they will pay for true-ups at the time of their renewal.

92285162,2021-08-19 16:30:14.304,Add  documentation to the CustomersDot REST API,"### Problem
Current REST API is not documented. To find out what we offer we need to check the code every time.

### Proposal
We could use [swagger](https://swagger.io/) for documentation.

- solves documentation & discoverability problem
- provides sandbox [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to allow developer and non developer to interact with APIs
- uses OpenAPI (fka Swagger Specification)

We would like to focus on `/subscription/*` endpoint first as it's the one we work the most at the moment

There is also [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag#getting-started) gem for auto generated docs

#### What are our gains
- clean documentation
- faster lookup of what we have and how to use it
- spec could be used as a draft for future GraphQL endpoint during migration
- faster onboarding of new team members

#### Implementation plan
| Step | Issue |
| ------ | ------ |
| Setup documentation | 👉 you are here |
| Write the actual yaml docs for subscription | :white_check_mark:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3667 |

#### What we need to do
**Option A (preferred):** 
- Add openAPI integration https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3509#note_660256083, make sure the authentication works
- Document `/subscription*` routes

**Option B (in case integration doesn't work how it should):**
- add swagger specs & rswag integration (inspiration ""https://medium.com/@clarkjohnson_85334/adding-swagger-docs-to-a-rails-6-api-using-rswag-a3e8bc577986)
- add swagger UI (documentation)

Both steps are critical because just documenting won't help in better discoverability

The new trial plans do not expire appropriately like the old plans do.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Create an ultimate trial using the current plans.  So that you have an `ultimate` trial plan.  (Not an `ultimate_trial` trial plan)

1. Enable the `trial_plans` and the `deprovision_newly_expired_subscriptions` feature flags for your local development environment.

1. Create an ultimate trial again.  This plan should end up with an `ultimate_trial` plan, because the `trial_plans` flag is enabled.  (`deprovision_newly_expired_subscriptions` is related to the `ExpireOrderCronJob` worker which comes into play later)

1. Open the billing pages for both plans.  In the screenshots below, we can see that both New Trial Group (`ultimate`) and Eric Group (`ultimate_trial`) have Ultimate Trial plans set to expire in the future.

New Trial Group (`ultimate`)

5. Set the system clock forward to a date after the Ultimate Trial expiry date.  In the running example, this would be any date after 2021-09-12.

Refresh the browser and observe what happens to each trial plan.  See the screenshots below.  New Trial Group (`ultimate`) shows that it is expired and we can see from the lack of an ""Epics"" menu item that the Ultimate features have been withdrawn.  However, Eric Group (`ultimate_trial`) shows an error from CustomersDot and the Ultimate Trial features are still present, as evidenced by the ""Epics"" menu item.

After the implementation of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1879 , users can no longer delete a group while there is a trial.

However, unlike a regular subscription, trials cannot be removed from a group. So a user must wait 30 days for the trial to expire before having the option to delete the group.

While it's not a complete blocker, it is a significant inconvenience for users. If they want it deleted earlier, they have to write into support, who can change the trial expiration date.

Just for reference, we encountered this while wanting to test: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/66951

### Proposal

Exclude trials from the subscription check for deletion of groups/namespaces. If needed, we can wait until the trial specific plans `ultimate_trial` and `premium_trial` are in use.

Users should be able to delete trial-only namespaces.

### Problem
Storybook has an outdated setup and is not widely used for dev/design topics rather for test runs.

### Proposal
We can get more out of the tool, it offers a great dev environment for isolated components. It can be used together by designer and developer to check components before they land in staging/production.

To achieve it, we could introduce a couple of addons that make developers lives easier. As a minimum, we should consider adding [essential addons](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/essentials/introduction) (especially [controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/essentials/controls) that offers dynamic props change). These addons are already used by `gitlab` project.

Also, it's time to migrate the setup to use `main.js`, `preview.js` and add postcss-addon on top. It would not only remove the deprecation warnings but make us ready for Storybook 7 (most likely to be released in 2021).

### Next steps (if any)
If we cover the two topics above, we can consider updating the old and/or building new stories utilizing mentioned addons and involving designers to check/test components and pages in Storybook.",2

As described in [this thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3034#note_639971420):

> Just to summarize where we are now, we decided that for renewals to be eligible for cloud licensing we would check a number of factors ([defined here in code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/b7ab6e6ec6167bfae68f5cd045e245bb7500c0c3/app/workers/zuora_callback_worker.rb#L113)) when processing the renewal amendment callout. The one that I'm wondering about is the gitlab version check. This check works by querying for the latest seat link record for the subscription where the gitlab version is available, and compares this version to the minimum version requirement for cloud licensing (14.1).
>
> I think this is a problem because after we decided on this path, we later decided to no longer send seat link data from GitLab starting on version 14.1 unless the SM instance did has a license with cloud licensing enabled. I don't see how any renewal would be eligible for cloud licensing given we won't receive the version data for 14.1.
> 
> Now that we are rolling out with both types of licenses (offline and cloud), I wonder if we shouldn't just remove the GitLab version requirement altogether. Before we were concerned about forcing customers into the cloud license strategy that they weren't prepared for, but that shouldn't matter now.
>
> It has some nice side benefits as well like:
>
> 1. Gets more people with the option of cloud licensing.

### Summary

Each time a license is downloaded from the `Customers Portal > Manage purchases` screen, a new license is generated.

### Steps to reproduce

- Go to `Customers Portal > Manage purchases` screen
- Use the `Download license` button to download the license file. Do this twice.
- Observe in https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license that the license was created twice. Inspecting the details page will show a different digest and key.
- Decoding the downloaded files will show that the information is the same in both files.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Each time a license is downloaded from the `Customers Portal > Manage purchases` screen, a new license is generated.

Possibly relevant is that for the subscription where I observed this behavior the existing license was present in LicenseDot, but not yet in CustomersDot.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Each time a license is downloaded from the `Customers Portal > Manage purchases` screen, the existing license is returned.

Many tried to pass the license file as an activation code during Cloud License activation. License files are all very long while activation codes are a length of 24 characters.

- We should also include some help text underneath the activation input field...<br>`This activation code is a 24-character alphanumeric string.`

```

### Problem

Seat Link fails when the license in the request contains a `zuora_subscription_id` that exceeds the limit (64 characters) for this column in the `license_seat_links` table.  This appears to be happening because LicenseDot does not have a length limit on the `zuora_subscription_id` column and some manually created licenses exceeded 64 characters.  When these licenses are received used for Seat Link, we see the errors like above.

In reality, a `zuora_subscription_id` should only be 32 characters in length so anything longer than that is likely a mistake.  It appears there are 9 licenses currently in LicenseDot that exceed this limit.  In all 9 cases, the `zuora_subscription_id` appears to be a mistake, where a URL was entered instead of an id (see below from LicenseDot).

### Proposal

This error should not happen with cloud licensing but there are things we can do to limit this happening going forward.  Here are some things to consider:

- We can validate the `zuora_subscription_id` when creating licenses.  We have an issue for this already: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3385.
- We should include rails validations on the `License` model to match the limit DB constraints for a better user experience when creating licenses.
- We could have sales or support provide corrected licenses to customers to avoid the errors above.",1

### Problem

The [daily pipeline run with empty VCR cassettes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/pipeline_schedules/118484/edit) has been disabled for over a year now. The pipeline didn't pass back then since a lot of new specs were added that use VCR cassettes but there wasn't a rerecordability for all of them.

### Proposal

After all other issues from [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6519) are closed, enable the daily pipeline run with empty VCR cassettes again.

### Problem

Similar to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3438, we may require an instance for LicenseDot to use for the daily pipeline run with empty VCR cassettes.

### Proposal

- Evaluate if it's sufficient to reuse LicenseDot staging since LicenseDot is going to be deprecated at some point (if yes, weight: 1)
- If the answer to the above is no, implement something like a temp instance similar to what is being done for a temp GitLab instance in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3438 (weight: 3)

### Problem

There are quite a few requests that are sent to a GitLab instance when running the test suite with empty VCR cassettes. Since the requests are not only get requests, but also put and post ones, we need a own GitLab instance for the daily pipeline run with empty VCR cassettes.

### Proposal

### Proposal

Allow the `super_sonics_aware` field to be editable from the Admin interface.  We should probably document when this feature should be used.

We realized in a few cases distinct customer records in CustomersDot can share the same `zuora_account_id`.  Cloud Activations have attributes for `subscription_name` and `customer_id`.

This leads to a problem where a customer that has access to a subscription but wasn't the creator of the subscription does not see the activation code in the subscription card in CustomersDot.

### Problem

Our [`NamespaceSelect` Component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/namespace_select.vue) helps us in managing the namespaces selection nicely. There are a couple of things we can improve though:

1. its API forces the parent to manually manage the state
1. its API seems to have knowledge the parents will use the data for some other actions
1. its usage from the parent components is not always consistent

|An example from Storybook|
|-|
|![Screenshot_2021-08-04_at_14.03.07](/uploads/ddb754f9c2d21767a70e3b313756b474/Screenshot_2021-08-04_at_14.03.07.png)|

### Proposal

To help with the improvements above, let's make the `NamespaceSelect` `v-model`-ready by [configuring it](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#model):
- using `change` event to propagate the selection, which is the newly selected `namespace`:
- `value` as the prop for the selected namespace
- `initialNamespaceId` would be good to stay only as a non-required prop to define the initially selected id

A selector is a quite common scenario where a `v-model` would turn useful to avoid 1). Also, a `v-model`-enabled component can support divergent usages (like the ones specified in the [notes below](#notes)), but should not be designed based on the assumption of such usages.

### Notes

The namespace selection is sometimes used to perform other operations as a consequence of the selection (see examples of usage). While this might not be ideal, changing this approach would result in a much larger scope. To circumvent this, we can rely on the usage of `watch`:

```js
watch: {
    selectedNamespace() {
      // operation to perform
    },
  },
```

In at least one case, the `change` event is just proxied. This is a valid approach for `v-model`-enabled components as well. We can keep it as-is.

### Result

Having this way, we can avoid manual handling of data mutation in some of the parent components using it. Here's a list of where it's used:

- [New GitLab Subscription Form](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/new_gitlab_subscription_form.vue)
- [Change Namespace Form](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/frontend/javascripts/subscription/components/change_namespace_form.vue)
- [Purchase Details Card](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/frontend/javascripts/purchase/components/purchase_details_card.vue)

91396768,2021-08-03 20:20:01.159,Multi Year Subscriptions and License file start/end dates,"### Summary

Self-managed subscriptions sold with a validity period greater than 12 months result in a license file always being generated for the original start date and original end date.  This includes any amendments made to the subscription, such as adding users, often resulting in the system generating a license file with a 12-month validity period in the past.


### Steps to reproduce

1. Have a multi-year subscription
1. Create any amendment to it that would result in a new license being generated, like adding seats to the license, during year 2 or 3.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

License files created with outdated validity periods. 

**Reason:**
* We generate a legacy license with `term_start_date` + 1 year based on our logic of generating all legacy licenses for 1 year.
* The problem with this is that `term_start_date` matches the original subscription start date - so when we are year 2 or 3 of a MY subscription and a new license is generated, it will be for the first year only.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
Generate a license file that matches the relevant, current year of the subscription.


### Workarounds

Generate license manually with the correct dates.

## Proposal
Dynamically calculate the license `end date` and license `start date` for a multi-year subscription on a legacy or offline license based on the provision date.
* By dynamically setting `end date` of the license based on the provision date, we ensure the license is aligned to the current term.
* By dynamically setting `start date` based on provision date, the 1-year increment logic can hold true, allowing true-ups to be calculated correctly. 

Note: an alternative option is to generate all legacy licenses for the full subscription term (i.e. 3 years) but this is not something we are prepared to move to at this time ([comment for details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3421#note_1230790958)).",3

91110851,2021-07-29 18:52:09.220,Some Admins do not have the expected access levels after Okta sign in,"### Problem

There are multiple reports of Admins, mostly Support team members, that do not have the expected read/write access to the Customers Admin interface.  It seems that after signing in via Okta, the Admin record is updated with the read only access level to Customers information. 

Please see this [Slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CK4EQH50E/p1627532249099000) for more details.

#### Background

[Two days ago we enabled the `admin_roles` feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/feature_flags/98/edit) in Production after receiving word that the necessary license app groups have been to the CustomersDot Okta app.  With this enabled, admin roles would be enforced and certain write actions would be restricted based on access levels.  These access levels should be set in [the `Admins::AuthenticateFromOmniauthService`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/blob/6bbe84277de0cb0c4b6e68dc86afbbe9285c723c/app/services/admins/authenticate_from_omniauth_service.rb#L4) which is executed after Okta redirects back to CustomersDot after successful sign in.   If the customers groups returned from Okta include the CustomersDot write access group (`okta-customerportal-users`), then the read/write access level would be assigned to the Admin.  

However, something seems to be amiss in this integration.  This could be a caching issue where CustomersDot is receiving stale group information.  However, admins have reported attempting to login with multiple browsers, even incognito windows, and still have the issue.

### Proposal

Investigate why this is occurring and fix it.  We need more logging in the authentication service in order to determine what groups CustomersDot is receiving from Okta.  Once we have that information, we should be able to determine if CustomersDot is receiving stale information, pointing to a caching problem, or if there is a bug in the service in CustomersDot.",2

90749259,2021-07-23 20:05:50.553,Validate Zuora subscription name and ID when creating licenses,"### Problem

As mentioned in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3379, we have instances where licenses have been manually created with a typo in the `zuora_subscription_name` field.  For example, it might include a leading or trailing whitespace by mistake.  This is a problem because this field is commonly used as a lookup to find the subscription associated with the licenses (e.g. Seat Link Service) but with the typo, the association is not found.

This was only found in about 13 licenses as of 2021-07-23 in LicenseDot production so it's a small problem but does lead to some noisy Sentry errors.  You can find the list of licenses in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3585#note_634371978).

### Proposal

Add a validation to CustomersDot when licenses are created to verify the `zuora_subscription_name` and `zuora_subscription_id` are valid by querying Zuora.  It's probably not worth adding this same validation to LicenseDot given it's a very small problem and would be more effort to connect to Zuora for validation in that application.",2

Specifically, in the cases I've seen (see Sentry links below), the `zuora_subscription_name` contains and extra whitespace character at the end of the string which causes `Zuora::Subscription` not to be found when queried.  In both cases, the licenses were created manually in LicenseDot.

This issue describes the smallest and simplest changes we can start iterating on to help our internal teams confirm that the provisioning email was sent.

## Proposal

#### MVC - 14.8
- Capture and set the date and time when the confirmation email with provisioning info was generated and sent.
- Display this information for each active subscription in Customers Admin Portal.
  - Option 1: within the Basic Info tab, add a field ""Delivery Confirmation"" This new line will display the date and time when the confirmation email containing the license was sent and the email address of who it was sent to
  - Option 2: add a new tab next to Show tab with label ""Delivery Confirmation"" This new tab will display the date and time when the confirmation email with the license was sent and the email address of who it was sent to
  - Option 3: Leverage Papertrail (version tracking gem) to store the email the license was sent to and the timestamp when it was sent. Use the History tab of a license object to display it - [Proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3370#note_804551801)

:rocket: The decision was to implement option 3 - See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3370#note_817042324.

90205411,2021-07-13 15:17:17.657,Frontend errors: use `ErrorBoundary` for error handling,"# Overview

As part of our effort to improve the frontend logs management in `CustomersDot`, as well as reduce code duplication and manual error handling, provide more useful and consistent error info to our users, we will implement a [_holistic_ approach to errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2279) which consists of 2 parts:

- [Centralise Sentry logs management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3349)
- Use `ErrorBoundary` for error handling (current)

The 2 parts have been individuated in a **[previous research with PoC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2935)** which helped define the approach. Some use cases are presented [here](https://vue-demo.xyz/).

##### Use `ErrorBoundary` Component for displaying UI errors

Advantages of `ErrorBoundary` Component are:

- follows a standard approach in the industry, see [React's ErrorBoundaries](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html#introducing-error-boundaries)
- implements our values of [boring solutions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#boring-solutions): it leverages [Vue errorCaptured hook](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#errorCaptured)
- increases maintainability: we rely on `GlAlert` for displaying errors, we can encapsulate its usage in the `ErrorBoundary`
- allows moving error messages definitions to a more central level (app or global configuration)

We will measure success by:

- reducing (eliminating) manual toggling of errors

<details>
<summary>The approach is also good for splitting responsibilities between layers and increasing the flexibility fo our error displaying management </summary>

- **responsibility** comes in terms of delegation when the UI/UX of errors for a (more or less long) chain of components can be handled at a centralized place. An `ErrorBoundary` Component is a quasi [render-less component](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/), that aims to help in scenarios where data and behaviors are often the same. Analog to this is the use of services such as `API`, `Vuex`, that lift from the component the burden of managing communication or data flow
- **flexibility** comes in terms of configuration. An `ErrorBoundary` Component is general enough to account for the majority of cases while also being close enough to the app where it's used to adapt to more specific cases where the desired behavior might need to change or adapt

</details>

##### Scenarios to consider

<details>
<summary>Errors coming from the ~backend are not suitable for being displayed to the user</summary>

We had [some cases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331148) where the error received from the ~backend was not offering much information to the ~frontend. The suggested approach will allow us:

- in the short run, to account for such cases in a more flexible way
- in the long run, to establish a way where the ~backend communicates with the ~frontend using codes (e.g. `UNSUCCESSFUL_X_Y_Z` instead of string literals, an approach that [already proved useful](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327255#note_556782292))

</details>

# Implementation plan

[Sentry Vue Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/configuration/integrations/default/) [attaches the `errorHandlder` to our Vue instance](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/integrations/src/vue.ts#L390). This will catch and log all the errors generated at runtime to the specified Sentry API.

After creating the `ErrorBoundary` Component, we should tackle each application one by one.

| Step | MR |
|-|-|
| Create the `ErroBoundary` Component (an [example](https://gitlab.com/agulina/vue-demo/-/blob/main/src/services/error_boundary.vue)) |  _tdb_ |

As part of our effort to improve the frontend logs management in `CustomersDot`, as well as reduce code duplication and manual error handling, provide more useful and consistent error info to our users, we will implement a [_holistic_ approach to errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2279) which consists of 2 parts:

- Use Sentry Integration for error logging (current)
- [Use `ErrorBoundary` for error handling](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3350)

The 2 parts have been individuated in a **[previous research with PoC](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/2935)** which helped define the approach. Some use cases are presented [here](https://vue-demo.xyz/).

##### Use Sentry Integration for error logging

We expect improvements in the following areas:

- separation of concerns: our components will only be responsible for *handling* errors, not for *logging* them
- DRYness: in most cases where we manually log errors, we're just proxying them. This only adds maintenance cost and no value
- using [boring solutions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#boring-solutions): we _already_ have most of the functionality in place, due to Sentry Integration being active [the following line](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/50ee3275a0177e192102268f93ce87f47ee07d8b/app/frontend/packs/sentry.js#L9)

We will measure them by:

- reduction or elimination of manual calls to `Sentry.captureMessage` and `Sentry.captureException` most of which are just proxying the error ([instances of `captureMessage`](https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=9970&project_id=2670515&repository_ref=&scope=blobs&search=Sentry.captureMessage&snippets=false) and [instances of `captureException`]((https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=9970&project_id=2670515&repository_ref=&scope=blobs&search=Sentry.captureException&snippets=false)))
- reduction or elimination of the checks for Sentry call in tests

##### Scenarios to consider

<details>
<summary>Errors based on [unprocessable entity](https://www.keycdn.com/support/422-unprocessable-entity)</summary>

We have had [some cases as such](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2697). Errors like this are very useful for the user in order to recover from them but may or *may not* be useful for our system. A centralized approach will let us configure which error we want to exclude at a higher level.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Dynamic rendering errors</summary>

Rendering errors are hard to handle mainly because of unpredictability: how would you know which component is gonna break and for which reason? It seems intuitive that only a centralized way can give enough confidence for such cases. Also note: by *dynamic* rendering errors here we mean the ones that might be caused by supplying inconsistent data to a component. Errors that prevent the component from rendering, whatever the point of failure is (a method, the template, etc), the kind of scenarios that would leave the page blank and log a red error in the console.
</details>

# Implementation plan

Vue offers an [errorHanlder config](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#errorHandler) which can be used as a unified place to where all errors can bubble up. [Sentry Vue Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/configuration/integrations/default/) [attaches the `errorHandlder` to our Vue instance](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/integrations/src/vue.ts#L390). This will catch and log all the errors generated at runtime to the specified Sentry API.

In order to make this work we will need to:

* always `return` `Promise` from Vue `methods` where async calls are made (if we don't do it, Sentry Integration will catch the error anyways, but it will also display as an uncaught error in the console)
* if the error is manually handled (in a `catch` block), always throw a new `Error`

##### Sentry.captureException

An example of how one can remove the manual `captureException` and let Sentry handle the error:

### Problem

With gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com#2876:
- `Price` and `Subtotal` lines in the Addons purchase will necessarily display the same values (there are no other products to purchase)
- the Unit Price of the product is not so evident and placed in a line that's not even so clear

90163707,2021-07-13 03:08:19.129,Previous user count is incorrect when changing products and seat count during renewal,"### Problem

When a subscription is renewed, and the user changes the product and the number of active users at the same time, the `previous_user_count` is the same as the new `user_count`.

This is because `Subscription#previous` finds the last version of the subscription and we use the result of this to get the `previous_user_count`. This is an issue when changing products and seats, because we generate an amendment of the subscription with the new product and the new seat count before processing the renewal amendment. This means the previous version at that point is the version with the new product and the new user count.

##### Example

![Screen_Shot_2021-07-13_at_3.10.22_PM](/uploads/d701cb402d3ee4a38b3353e051b77556/Screen_Shot_2021-07-13_at_3.10.22_PM.png)

^ In this example, we renew the initial subscription (V1) and change the product from premium to ultimate. We also change the user count (which was 10 in V1 and is then 15 in V3). When we process the renewal, we look for the most recent previous version and this is returning V3 currently. This means we're creating the license with `user_count: 15, previous_user_count: 15` but it should be `user_count: 15, previous_user_count: 10`

#### 🐛 Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new self-managed license via CustomersDot
1. Navigate to the renewal page for that license
1. Renew the license with:
   1. Changed product (ie Premium -> Ultimate)
   1. Changed number of users
1. View the license in the db: `previous_users_count == user_count`

#### 📸 Screenshots

![Example](/uploads/9e44db1ba9601d91dc6464efa7ccce22/count_present.mp4)


### Proposal

I'm not entirely sure how to address this, it will likely require some investigation. We need to get the version of the subscription before we made the renewal amendments, or we need to store the `previous_user_count` somewhere else and look it up from there.

The following issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1393 introduced the limitation of showing 'Renew' button up to 30 days after subscription expiration, but hiding it after 30 days.

Per comment here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/deal-desk/-/issues/102#note_622857803 from @jrabbits [The foundational policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#late-renewals) now states that renewals can be closed up to 45 days after the renewal date. This requires a modification of the logic from 30 days to 45 days.

The `SubscriptionCurrentVersionFinder` makes the use of `SubscriptionVersionFinder` and finds the subscriptions which were active on `Date.current`. 

We can simply make a call to `SubscriptionVersionFinder` and use the method current_version which will make use of `Date.current` without having to use the whole calls being inherited from `SubscriptionVersionFinder`.

Update: In addition to the above, we will also update the logic where `SubscriptionCurrentVersionFinder` is used to use the new POC logic introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4246+ instead.

### How will we measure success?

### Problem

Since CustomersDot rely on IronBank to connect to Zuora, this prevent CustomersDot from working with Zuora central sandbox. This blocks issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2848

Details in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2848#note_616941950

### Proposal

Two options so far:
1. Bump iron_bank gem version to [v5.2.3](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/releases/tag/v5.2.3), which contains the [fix exactly for this issue](https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank/pull/74).
2. Monkey patch the fix in CustomersDot, on top of existing iron_bank gem 4.4.1

In local environment, with monkey patch, I have verified IronBank can query from Central Sandbox(`rest.test.zuora.com`) successfully.

Option 1 is preferred. Asked in slack to see whether people have concern to bump iron_bank gem version https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1625186996057700

Thanks @jameslopez to suggest a nice checklist in MR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3504 - we should follow the checklist.
* [x] Follow the regular process to create the MR. Make sure this issue is Public.
* [x] Make sure the maintainer adds the ~""production::blocker"" label to this issue once the MR is ready to be merged
* [x] Once the MR lands in Staging, announce the changes in `#s_fulfillment` and request help for testing all the different flows affected
* [x] Announce the changes in `#support_licensing-subscription`
* [x] Create a revert MR targeting `master` to quickly deploy to production should anything go wrong
* [ ] Inform the `@sre-oncall` about the potentially breaking changes
* [x] Remove the ~""production::blocker"" label if tested has completed succesfully, wait for production deployment
* [x] If everything looks good after a few hours/days (depending on the change), close the revert MR
* [ ] If there has been a problem, merge the revert MR into `master`, inform Infrastructure/`@sre-oncall` to trigger a `chef` deploy (if urgent) and push the changes to the `staging` branch last

### Proposal

This appears to be related to a recent change in the way licenses are downloaded in CustomersDot, introduced in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3315.  After a cursory look, this seems to be happening in the `ObtainLicenseService` where the license is being compared to the current subscription.  However, this code should not be used yet as it should be behind the `cloud_license_sync` feature flag.",2
88823997,2021-06-16 15:27:30.234,Conditionally create a license in CustomersDot if missing using feature flag,"### Problem

As described in [this Slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CMJ8JR0RH/p1623853191158300), we realized that a handful of licenses were being created in CustomersDot rather than LicenseDot before the `cloud_license_sync` feature flag was enabled.  It turns out this began after we merged https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3315 which creates a license if one doesn't exist when users attempt to download or copy a license.  This feature creates the license using CustomersDot rather than LicenseDot, which wasn't expected until the `cloud_license_sync` is enabled.

### Proposal

Update the `ObtainLicenseService` to avoid creating a license in CustomersDot if the `cloud_license_sync` feature is disabled.  Instead we should fallback to the old behavior of raising an error instead.",2
88773290,2021-06-15 22:47:45.897,Customers should only be able to renew 15 days before subscription expiration date,"### Problem

Today, customers are able to renew their subscription early via the Customer Portal. This can create various downstream issues, like the following:

1. [Early renewal can cause issues for reconciliations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3182)
1. [Prevent users from accidentally renewing multiple times
](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/1099) 
1. [Renewing subscription multiple times will cause trueup error when its count is changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3268)

Sales Assisted renewals have already been aligned to the [FY22 Booking Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#renewal-opportunities), which states that we wait to close the renewal till 15 days from renewal date.  We now need to align self-service renewals to the same policy.

Original issue thread: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3182#note_599340590

### Proposal

Prevent early renewals by hiding ""Renew"" button 15 days before Subscription End Date, and add a related check in the backend. 

~backend specific tasks:

- Lock down the `/renew` route from the backend. Hiding the `renew` button isn't sufficient since we're linking to the renew route from multiple places (CustomersDot, Billing page)

~frontend specific tasks:

- Disable the ""Renew"" button 15 days before Subscription End Date
- Add a tooltip explaining why it's disabled (perhaps `Ability to renew will be available in X days`)

### Result

Customers can only renew their subscription 15 days before renewal date.

88663144,2021-06-14 10:30:08.677,Expired subscriptions downgrade - modify Plan scope,"### Summary

The expired subscription downgrade process is based on this following query:

```
orders = Order.saas_subscriptions.full.where('end_date < ?', expiration_date)
```

The use of the `saas_subscriptions` scope means that we're limiting our query so that only orders related to specific Plan are  retrieved.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The retrieved `Order` objects are related to one of the following plan:
- Ultimate Saas 1 Year plan: `2c92a0ff76f0d5250176f2f8c86f305a`
- Premium Saas 1 Year plan: `2c92a00d76f0d5060176f2fb0a5029ff`

Follow up from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3292

We have data in the following views that relies on the `GitlabPlansHelper` for loading and formatting the data for the frontend:

1. `app/views/subscriptions/community_program/new_saas.html.haml`
1. `app/views/subscriptions/community_program/new_self_managed.html.haml`
1. `app/views/subscriptions/_new_gitlab_com_subscription.html.haml`
1. `app/views/subscriptions/_new_ee_subscription.html.haml`

We should extract the data loading out of this helper (into the controller?) ~~and move the presentation logic to a presenter so that it is easier to test~~. Helper methods are available across all controllers, so moving this logic to a presenter class will help us signal more clearly what it applies to.

### Proposal

1. Load and filter the eligible namespaces in the controller/services instead of the view helper

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3163, the `SeatLinkCreateService` was updated to always save `LicenseSeatLink` records with a `report_timestamp`, even when `timestamp` isn't provided in the request params.  If `timestamp` is missing, the `date` param is used to construct a timestamp instead (e.g. `date` + 3:00 UTC). This was added in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/3356.  Other MRs related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3163 were merged to remove the dependence on `report_date` like backfilling `report_timestamp`, along with transitioning DB constraints from `report_date` to `report_timestamp`.

With these changes, we no longer need to continue storing or referencing `report_date` on `LicenseSeatLink`.  All logic in CustomersDot should use `report_timestamp`.

### Proposal

In this issue, we should finish the steps to removing `report_date`.

- Remove any remaining references to `report_date`
- Ignore the column in the model.
- Remove the column from the database.",2

After a license expires, the GitLab instance becomes blocked and git features like pushes are blocked. Here's a link to the docs on this: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/license.html#what-happens-when-your-license-expires. When a customer is using a license file they will renew their subscription and upload a new license file to reinstate the features or remove the license file. This will be the same behaviour for cloud licenses, but there is currently no way for a customer to remove a cloud license from their self-managed instance. This issue is to design/investigate the removal of a cloud license. [Original discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3215#note_595998053).

I've created [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/3512) to also discuss a better way to gracefully handle the downgrading of an expired license as I'm unsure whether we should be blocking git features like pushes.

As entering the user address is optional, we have to make the component that displays the customer info conditionally show the address. At the moment, when the user hasn't entered an address, we display an empty HTML container that has spacing applied to it. This doesn't result in predictable vertical spacing and it hinders accessibility.

Maybe as part of this issue we can revisit the HTML elements that are shown inside of the customer info component so we make sure they're semantic.

UI improvement proposed - a temporary text field showing `Processing...` on invoice page instead of providing a download link when invoice is not ready from Zuora :point_down:

88047848,2021-06-01 15:21:33.554,Perform amendment to update rate plan charge for EOA,"As part of the main issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/2783, we have worked on calling to [update the `rate_plan_charge`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L267) whenever the user has [accepted/declined the EOA offer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/services/amendment_base_service.rb#L272). 

This callback is made after the renew has been amended and [via a background job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/workers/update_subscription_eoa_starter_bronze_offer_worker.rb) which makes a call to update the custom value [`EoaStarterBronzeOfferAccepted__c`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/staging/app/workers/update_subscription_eoa_starter_bronze_offer_worker.rb#L43) and then traverses though the rate_plans to find the rate_plan_charges which are part of PREMIUM plans and then make the changes to the `price_change_option`.

These changes can be resulted into an error by Zuora which is then just logged into the Sentry and no rescue of the error is then called in place.  

### Proposal

The amendment takes place in a batch and if one results in error then all of it is rolledback by Zuora. Instead of calling the update on `rate_plan_charges` after the amendment happens we can add another amendment to the batch to update the rate_plan_charges `price_change_option` itself.
