86814622,2019-12-17 20:29:25.751,Pajamas: New UX architecture,"## Problem
<!-- What’s the problem? Why is it worth solving? -->
### GitLab is a Gardener
The great George RR Martin once said...
> “I think there are two types of writers, the **architects** and the **gardeners**. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.” 

*  **Gardener** - Bottom-up, experimental, opportunistic, looking for emerging structures
*  **Architect** - Top-down, regimented, tightly-controlled, looking to balance the high level with the lower level from the start

I think this mindset can be applied to any creative field (such as design), however, I don't think you necessarily need to be either a `Gardener` or an `Architect`.
**IMO... GitLab is culturally over-indexing on the `Gardener` side of things.**

### The challenge with being a Gardener
Based on my onboarding experience and use of Pajamas, this Gardener mindset has led to a number of pain points...
*  The onboarding experience is scary
*  Design documentation and resources (from my perspective) are quite diffuse across GitLab
*  It's hard to quickly understand what GitLab as a product is - and how it fits together

...There is an opportunity to restructure the experience and content of our Pajamas Design System to ease the onboarding experience and architect content in a more noob-friendly way.

## Solution
<!-- What’s the solution? Why is it like that? What are the benefits?) -->
Let's introduce just the right amount of `Architect` into our design system...

I have taken a stab at re-architecting the general experience ([see Pajamas Design System - Architecture Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1576610115252/7ba61a8eaf98c494b8d603439d37011757c86b8c?wid=0-1576610284030&outline=open)) - trying to balance a bottom-up *and* top-down approach to a design system. This is WIP and a first iteration of course... I will need input from a broader audience to take into account everything that's important.

See... 
* [Pajamas: Actionable Principles Update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/797)
* [Pajamas: Define Conceptual Object Model](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/789)

With a more balanced approach to PJ's UX architecture, I believe we can...
*  Make onboarding easier through clarity & purpose
*  Simplify the information architecture of http://design.gitlab.com/ 
*  Provide greater context for our lovely components

This is very abstract atm... but I will follow up with how this new type of architectural thinking can benefit the new table and sorting components I am working on.

I would love some feedback! Let me know what you think.

This issue is to discuss setting up additional monitoring and metrics to increase visibility into the deployed instances.

1. Specify space on top and bottom
1. Specify height growth strategy if needed 
1. Specify max-height

We need to reconsider the layout of empty states and how they refactor on smaller screens. Today the design documentation states: 

#### Description
* If the description needs to wrap on desktop, align it to the left.
* If the title needs to wrap on desktop, align both the title and description to the left.
* If the title and description do not wrap on desktop, center them horizontally.

This is causing some compromises to the design of empty states. Instead, we should consider a layout that doesn't need to mix center-aligned and left-aligned titles and body copy. 


@tauriedavis proposed this layout:

### Further details

- 404s are bad UX; we should check the docs to assure we don't have them
- The recent change to use the `#` led to broken links, as noted by the community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Citizen_Drain/status/1064886792657281024) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6473126444728872960/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6472126819968524288%2C6473126423233077248))
- There were some broken links that went unnoticed: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/merge_requests/165

### Proposal

Implement a broken link checker, preferably in a job (not allowed to fail) that runs with the entire pipeline. As inspiration, checkout how GitLab Docs implemented their external link checker: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-docs/merge_requests/360

15646520,2018-11-07 23:51:02.749,Mixed usage of automatic saving for radio buttons might create a brittle user experience,"### Problem

Mixed usage of automatic saving for radio buttons might create a brittle user experience — as if anything can happen without warning

### Origin

*Follow-up from ""adding radio buttons documentation"" at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/merge_requests/106#note_115355022*

The question was: Should or should users not expect radio buttons to yield immediate results?

### Further information

I made the case for them not to be (which is backed up by [nngroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/)), but @tauriedavis suggested otherwise (which is backed up by [existing UI in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/design.gitlab.com/uploads/1eba37a0e276c02fd9c8bd96588df112/Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_11.50.46_AM.png)). 

https://design.gitlab.com/foundations/saving-and-feedback comes into play here as it states we are anticipating saving by default as it has a positive impact on the perceived speed of the application. This is great but there is a potential discrepancies:

Documented safety measures only account for potential data loss. There is no documentation on how we handle feedback to the user that we will not auto-save data that might have a financial, security, or privacy impact before the user actually interacts with the element.

### Illustrating situations

```

### Quoted information from sources

from https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons

> Use checkboxes and radio buttons only to change settings, not as action buttons that make something happen. Also, the changed settings should not take effect until the user clicks the command button (labeled ""OK"" for example, or ""Proceed to XXX"" where ""XXX"" is the next step in a process).

>  Conversely, violating the standards makes the user interface feel brittle — as if anything can happen without warning. Say, for example, that you assume you can click on a radio button without any immediate impact, and can thus consider your choices after making a selection but before hitting ""OK."" In such a case, it's jarring when a website violates this standard and unexpectedly moves you to the next page once you enter a selection. Worse, it makes you fear what may happen as you work with forms elsewhere on the site.

https://design.gitlab.com/foundations/saving-and-feedback

> Never apply to whole forms (example: adding a personal access token needs a name, expiration date, and access scope; it doesn’t make sense to auto-save the token name field individually). The auto-save method should ideally be only used for data that affects the user editing it. Auto-saving shouldn’t be applied to data that might have financial, security, or privacy impacts, example: changing password or changing the confidentiality of an issue.

> Instant feedback simply means that we show the expected result of a successfully saved change even before that change has actually been saved—we anticipate that the change will be saved successfully so we show it in the UI immediately. This has a positive impact on the perceived speed of the application. An example of a case when a successful result is expected is changing the assignee on an issue.

### How does success look like?

We prevent the user interface from feeling brittle when using radio buttons — as if anything can happen without warning

34692858,2017-09-29 15:43:54.784,Design for Tabs within tabs (contextual tabs),"### Overview

We can several places in GitLab where we have top-level tabs for categories but we need further context within and thus we use tabs under the content of top-level tab. One such example is on `/dashboard/projects` page which looks like this;

![image](/uploads/fb989f15d7e9938485dda1daebd2e3d4/image.png)

Tabs inside tabs is very common UX pattern and it is generally preferred to have slightly different design for _sub-tabs_ than the one you have to main tabs.

#### See the discussions around this design in following threads on StackExchange.

*  [Is there evidence to suggest that designing tabs within tabs creates a bad user experience?](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/5136/is-there-evidence-to-suggest-that-designing-tabs-within-tabs-creates-a-bad-user)
*  [Elegant, simple and obvious sub-tabs?](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/16281/elegant-simple-and-obvious-sub-tabs)

#### Proposal

Let's discuss possible alternative designs (or reasoning behind current design) :smiley:

I think [Bootstrap Pills](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#nav-pills) are ideal choice when we want to have nested tabs but I'll leave our options open. :slight_smile:

Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.

For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.

-->

### Description

The mini pipeline graph appears in multiple places in the product, but it's actually not one single component but multiple instances with varying functionality. It leads to a lot of inconsistency since the updates to one instance don't propagate to the rest of the instances. Having a single mini pipeline graph component will ensure consistency of experience across the product and make it easier to implement further improvements.

#### Audit of current component instances

:link: [Audit: Mini Pipeline Graph Components](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332948)

The goal of this issue is to document the mini pipeline graph component and its behavior with minor updates that improve the visual consistency and usability. Any big updates will be addressed as a follow-up.

This will also affect the export name. Along side this, I've ensured that all icon components will export as a .svg file.

87036969,2021-05-13 14:07:18.818,Pajamas nav > Reconsider parent item function,"## Purpose

In the Pajamas navigation a parent item both expands the subnav and takes a user to the first page of the subnav with the same click. Given that we don't make use of section overview pages this behavior feels a bit odd and misleading. While it's not difficult to determine where you landed, I don't think it's the most intuitive. It can also create a delay when you only wanted to access a page within that category, but have to wait for the first page to load before navigating where you wanted.

I'd like to propose that the parent item only expands/collapses the subnav list and does not have it's own destination.",1
87036283,2021-05-13 13:55:45.918,Consider dropping the use of details/summary in the navbar,"The following discussion from !2371 should be addressed:

- [ ] @jeldergl started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2371#note_574973550):  (+3 comments)

    > The use of `details` and `summary` here feels out of place semantically. I need to test this in a screen reader, but I'm wondering what the reason is for using it?

The navbar currently leverages `<details>` and `<summary>` elements to render collapsible menu items. This might not be a valid use-case for those elements, let's consider dropping them in favor of simple `v-if`s in the Vue components.

## Implementation plan

- [x] Drop the use of summary elements in favor uls and v-ifs.
- [x] Do not automatically select the first child item when clicking on a parent.
- [x] Keep the behavior where only one menu section can be expanded at a time.
- [x] Improve navbar's accessibility by leveraing `role` and `aria-` attributes.",2

From discussion on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2361#note_568114665, it sounds like the order of pages is because the nav items are automatically placed in alphabetical order. In this section, that leaves us with a surprising result - the Overview item is third and the more detailed pages (Charts, Color) are first.

Should we consider re-ordering the pages in this section based on content rather than alphabetizing? 

If so, perhaps the order could be:

- Overview
- Color
- Charts 
- Single stat",1
86503119,2021-05-05 09:18:26.731,Document a conceptual object model for Jobs,"## Problem

Jobs are the main building block of a pipeline. Understanding the essence of Jobs and the concepts associated with them can help us create a better experience around Jobs in GitLab UI. Currently, Jobs are not documented as an object in GitLab. It's difficult to find information around all the concepts associated with jobs and how they're represented in the UI.

## Proposal

Document Jobs using the Conceptual Object Model. 

This model allows for proper separation of concerns: concepts (meaning) and user interface (representation). In other words, a conceptual model is only focused on the concepts and how they relate to each other, not how it’s technically implemented or used in the UI. A conceptual model defines the objects and actions, and enumerates the attributes for every object. The language of the conceptual model diagram is meant to be as simple and accessible as possible to everyone, even if they are not familiar with these kinds of diagrams (for more information, see [Object Modeling for Designers](https://medium.com/@hpadkisson/object-modeling-for-designers-an-introduction-7871bdcf8baf).

Here's an example of how we document the [Merge Request as an object in GitLab.](https://design.gitlab.com/objects/merge-request)

#### Next steps

- [x] Document the concepts associated with Jobs
- [x] Map the concepts associated with Jobs
- [x] Document the layouts for the representations of Jobs in GitLab
- [x] Review the Figma file
- [x] Merge to the Conceptual object model file in Figma
- [x] Map the primary Job page layout
- [x] Merge the semantic layout to the Layouts file 
- [x] Work on a documentation MR ([MR in review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2713))

I have a need to use a long description to explain what does this toggle is about instead of short help text like ""disabled by admin"". If I use the help text, it looks like this:

Those live example copies need to be refined. But the length and format illustrate the problem we will face. Long copy and copy with ""learn more"". I think we should discuss this because in English the copy might be short, but in another language, a two-line description might be common when we face German or another lengthy language.

**This has two problems:**

1. The description is far from the label it belongs to and closer to the label of the next item. This creates more cognition load for a user to figure out, this description belongs to which one?
1. It is too long and visually looks unbalanced

>- **Critical:** This issue results in blocked content for individuals with disabilities. Until a solution is implemented content will be completely inaccessible, making the organization highly vulnerable to legal action.
>- **Serious:** This issue results in serious barriers for individuals with disabilities. Until a solution is implemented, some content will be inaccessible, or significant a work-around is required, making the organization vulnerable to legal action. Users with disabilities may experience significant frustration when attempting to access content.
>- **Moderate:** This issue results in some barriers for individuals with disabilities but would not prevent them from accessing fundamental elements or content. Users with disabilities may experience moderate frustration when encountering this issue.

[Labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html) in GitLab have historically been tightly coupled with Issues, Epics, and Merge Requests ~""group::project management"".

Pajamas merely states that there is only a differentiation in the UI, but there is a unique feature tied to [exclusivity](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#scoped-labels) in scoped labels for project management. Compliance Frameworks are currently using scoped labels just for visual flair, although it is not possible to apply more than one Compliance Framework to a project today.

Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”
-->

## Description

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding
a checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross reference everything that has been completed. -->

This is a follow up issue to [Figma component > Add Tables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/721). The table currently is still missing responsive states and is not leveraging some of Figma's newer layout features. 

### Summary of overall table updates:

- All cell content is now `top` aligned by default
- The sorting arrow has been moved closer to the right of the header label, in order to make it clear which header label they belong to 
- On hover and on focus states have been to header cells if the configuration is set to sortable
- A new 'compressed` table option has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/449)
- A new row state has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/884)
- A new `<caption>` component has been added (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/1726)
- A top border has been added to the header row in order to better visual understand where the table starts and ends on a page

### Summary of Figma specific updates:

Since the first version of the Figma Table component that has been added to our component library, Figma has introduced many new features specific to [Auto Layout](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-auto-layout) that make creating tables more flexible. This update will make it easier for designers to create responsive tables in Figma that are easier to customize and lower the need to detach from parent components. 

**Sorting interaction spec:**

![table-interaction](/uploads/dd95bd2653ad5b3ea6f27e27d91c272e/table-interaction.mp4)

### Rationale for current updates

| Overall component usage (last 90 days) | Variants being used (last 90 days) |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.27.15_2x](/uploads/e2d38b9540191eac779dcb460a11292c/CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.27.15_2x.png) | ![CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.28.42_2x](/uploads/f51c5d9412375aea6d004c33619fc742/CleanShot_2022-01-13_at_12.28.42_2x.png) | 
| **Insights:**<br>In the first version of the table component a lot of time was put into creating the multi-line variant which shows no usage. | **Insights:**<br>The checkbox variant is the second most used. This newer update makes it easier to turn on/off the selectable state for entire rows. |

   - For changes to an existing file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.
   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project.

   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:

“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”
-->

### Description

`form_input_group` was introduced in GitLab UI (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2115) which includes a form input that is grouped together with another element, such as a label or button. 

This component is being used on the `new fork` page, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/53544

We don't currently have this component within our UI Kit and the styling in GitLab UI does not match our visual language.

The purpose of this issue is to get the component within Figma, and then to open up the needed issues in GitLab UI to correct the styling.

@lvanc and I noticed that there are some cases are missing in our current dropdown component while adding the filter component. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/720

We can add this to the existing component as variants or/and instances.

And switch to the variants style structure and make the component more flexible.

### Description

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding

I worked a lot recently with a tooltip. I found that the current component is not very easy to use because:

1. I need to detach it every time because the container doesn't auto grow with the text
1. After detach, I need to resize it and not very easy to keep the spacing manually
1. I need to hide/show arrows in the layers instead of using a variant

So I updated the tooltip component structure with variants, now it can auto grow, two lines just need to hit enter and use different arrow position can be chosen from variants manual on the right-hand side. Please see the picture below :point_down: or watch this [`video intro`](https://www.loom.com/share/bd509b045e8e41f5ae4eb29fc22fb32f).

77176298,2021-01-13 16:46:21.198,Guideline to open help links in new tab or not,"In the [helping users](https://design.gitlab.com/usability/helping-users) section of the pajamas, we make use of two kinds of text links. While it's clear what the text should be, there's no guideline whether that link should open in a new tab or not.

We do however have some general guidelines about [external links](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/interaction/#links-to-external-resources).

## More details

I personally am in favor of the new tab functionality, and this makes sense for GitLab.com where we now redirect all help links to the external site https://docs.gitlab.com.

For self-managed instances however, the help links still point to the `/help` page of the instance.

## Accessibility issues

Best practice for accessibility by default is to use native browser behavior and open in the same window.
Once `target=""_blank""` is used it disables all other browser options, so it’s best to let the user choose.

This is an issue created based on [another issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues). Before we document something we agree on, we want to explore different solution options.

### Problem

In some areas, the user needs to set up complicated settings, such as variable sets with some details fine-tuning. Each variables settings is a group, and users need to see them together to have a better overview or comparing different variable groups.

The design needs to be flexible for desktop and mobile, easy to read and identify the groups.

73936334,2020-11-05 19:45:18.779,Content section > Determine how to dedupe documentation with doc styleguide,"# Problem

There are currently multiple places where we have content guidelines including:

* Pajamas: [Punctuation](https://design.gitlab.com/content/punctuation), [Terminology](https://design.gitlab.com/content/terminology), [Voice and tone](https://design.gitlab.com/content/voice-tone)
* Docs: [Styleguide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html)
* Handbook: [Styleguide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/style-guide/), [Markdown](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/markdown-guide/)

There is repeated content in all of these sections, making it difficult to know when to go where for what.

We've started trying to harmonize this content between the different areas, which is resulting in content that is not DRY. For example, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26326 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2148.

Tech writing has started to look at both styleguides and align them here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/636. However, we need to determine the IA in order to ensure that we are not continuing to duplicate content over time.

# Solution

Determine how to dedupe content docs in all various locations. This could include:

- Moving all content docs to one area
    - Pros: Everything is in one place, you always know where to go to find what you need. Content isn't duplicated.
    - Cons: There are separate use cases for docs and product, so the documentation in this section could be expansive. Good IA would be needed so its easy to find details.
- Keeping documentation docs and product docs separate, with clear cross-linking as needed.
    - Pros: Separation of concerns could make it easier to find detailed docs as needed
    - Cons: A lot of content overlaps, so it may be difficult to fully dedupe and could mean lots of cross linking and jumping back and forth between sections.",8

These were a few that came to mind, and I found it very helpful to think through objectives specific to the system itself.

Feel free to add your own, and perhaps we can have further exploration on a few of these. All of the below ramp up to a larger objective of making the product more beautiful, performant and accessible for users, while providing clear _foundational_ answers to common questions so that designers can focus on designing and not on rehashing what should be “boring” decisions.

Standardise on a solution for clearing the selection from a dropdown:
1. Document approach
1. Add functionality at the component-level

There are a few ways of going about it...

71028980,2020-09-11 13:48:52.161,WIP: Add complex List Item components to Pajamas,"<!--
Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes to an existing file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.
   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”
-->

### Description

Currently, in Pajamas, the ""List"" component(s) that are defined speak mostly to the Markdown list and don't include complex list items as seen throughout the product. To address this, I suggest we make 2 large scale changes: 

1. Move the current list descriptions to the `Typography` section of Pajamas. 
1. Update the List components to include complex list items as displayed throughout the product (see examples below).

70886070,2020-09-08 15:55:39.441,Make responsive segmented control,"### Problem

Currently our [segmented control component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/segmented-control) isn't very responsive on small screens when the component has many options (see below screenshot).

![Screen_Shot_2020-08-31_at_9.31.20_AM](/uploads/00c01eef0681be6929cf16273669643d/Screen_Shot_2020-08-31_at_9.31.20_AM.png)

We don't have a current design for how to fix this.

### Proposal

Some possible solutions:

- [Vertical variation for button groups](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/button-group#vertical-variation)
- Wrapping the component
- Making the last button a dropdown with the extra options inside of it.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201959/ we will introduce an update to the ~""component:skeleton-loader"" of the Releases page. This issue adds a variation of the gilab-ui component so that users can be able to see a loading state that always represent Releases in a recognizable way.

- The component variation should be called: `release-card-skeleton-basic`.
- I propose adding the UI to the Product Pages figma file.

Several inline text elements need to be added to the component library in Figma. We need to determine where they best fit since they can cross over between UI and markdown.

![CleanShot_2020-08-18_at_16.23.30_2x](/uploads/44b5bceeb2d14fc6023e1cfff2e87913/CleanShot_2020-08-18_at_16.23.30_2x.png)

## Solution

* Audit the product to find inline elements that can’t be created with styles alone (the ones in the image above have backgrounds).
* Create components for each inline variant.
* Determine the best location in the component library and publish the additions.

### Description

Gauge chart visualization is useful for monitoring the status of a metric in real time, and to quickly convey the status of the metric in relation to the ranges or a threshold set by the user. A gauge chart is a single metric chart.

#### Example use case

An SRE viewing metrics in the Metrics dashboard when investigating an incident. A gauge chart instantly communicates to the user the status of the metric, even when viewed at a small size. At a glance the user understands whether the value is falling within an acceptable range.

#### Requirements

- The chart should clearly communicate the current value and show where that value falls within the ranges set by the user (2 or 3 ranges can be set).
- Users can set alerts on the metric, so we need to make sure that when the alert is firing it's immediately visible
- The value ranges don't have to coincide with the alert threshold. The user should be able to set an alert for any value regardless of what range it falls into
- The chart should be readable even at a very small size. It's not uncommon for our users to have multiple gauge charts crammed into a small dashboard area to form a ""speedometer"" of sort. Check out [one of the GitLab dashboards ](https://dashboards.gitlab.com/d/sv_pUrImz/ci-autoscaled-machines-metrics?orgId=1&refresh=5m&from=now-30d&to=now&var-dc=All&var-runner_group=All&var-cpu_mode=nice)for an example. Currently, GitLab Metrics charts aren't resizeable, but they will be in the future.

#### States/ variants

- [x] Alert set
- [x] Alert firing
- [x] Low range, mid range, high range
- [x] Large (expanded chart view)
- [x] Small (50%)

### Additional details

We will be building the chart using the [Gauge e-charts component.](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge)

Notes for the docs:
- Leave a note in the component description that states that the header is mandatory but the size should vary depending on page content/hierarchy. 

<!--Add a short description of the component. If it’s helpful, add a checklist of variations
and states to the description so that a reviewer can be sure to cross reference everything

33865614,2020-04-27 16:12:27.424,PJs component page template: re-evaluate content based on JTBDs,"## Overview

Let's re-evaluate the content (and structure) of the PJs component page template to improve the utility and usability for GitLab designers, devs and PMs. This is related to the broader PJs information architecture challenges mentioned in gitlab-org/gitlab-design#798. 

The best way to prioritise, manage and refine the content on the page is by using Jobs to be done.

## Problem

The main pain points I found with component page templates today:

- **Text-heavy** - PJs is much more text-heavy than most other design systems. Much of the text content could be replaced with images and demos. The large amount of content makes it hard to scan and find the information I'm looking for.
- **Usage guidance vs implementation guidance** - Content on implementation guidance ([as discussed here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/536)) is left in the usage guidelines - adding to the text-heaviness. This also reduces the clarity on the usage guidance in general.
- **Burying the lead** - The current structure is setting pages up in a way where the demo is at the bottom of the page behind a bunch of text which may or may not be relevant for your use case. A new structure is required which front loads the demo and dives into details later. Following similar ideas to the [Minto Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7).
- **Additional content** - We also have a lot of other content that could be interesting to include in a design system as stated in [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/1111) - this doesn't need to be shown on the page, but could at least be linked, so we see the thought and rationale that has gone into designing the component
- **Variation** - There a lot of inconsistency in how component usage guidelines are written.

## Idea

> “If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings” - **David Kelley, IDEO** 

Some general principles for laying out these pages:
- **JTBD & role-informed** - We should differentiate sections and prioritise what content goes on the page based on what our primary personas are trying to achieve
- **Demo-heavy** - We should front-load our component pages with visual content and demos for a quicker understanding
- **Show me > tell me** - We should strip away as much text as possible in favour of demos and programmatically embedding rules, styles and interactions
- **On-page nav** - We should have on-page navigation for quicker access to particular sections
- **Standardise component usage sub-sections** - We should standardise on component usage sub-sections to improve consistency and clarity (e.g.[IBM carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage#content) standardized on component variations, content guidelines & interactions/functionality). This also makes it easier to spot whether any functionality or styles are missing.

I think [IBM Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) and [Salesforce Lightning](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) are both great examples of prioritising which JTBD they want to satisfy for designers & devs without being too text-heavy.

## Jobs to be done

Create a ranked list of JTBD to prioritise content on the page:

| Title | Situation | Motivation | Desired outcome | Persona |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **General usage guidance** | When I am unfamiliar with a component, | I want a quick and high-level overview of the what the component looks like, how it works and its most popular use cases, | so that I know whether or not I should use it. | All |
| **Design tool component** | When using a component, | I want a representation of that component in Figma/Sketch | so that I can quickly work with it in my designs | Designer |
| **Detailed usage guidance** | When using a component, | I want to understand details of variations, style, functionality and accessibility | so that I use the component in the way it was designed | Designer |
| **Component usage in the product** | When using a component, | I want to where else in the product it is being used, how much it is being used and for what use cases, | so that I | All |
| **Design decisions** | When using a component, | I want to understand how research, discussions & usage helped decide on a specific design, tenet or guideline | so that I understand why the component was designed in that way | Designer |
| **Component gaps** | When using a component, | I want to understand whether this current iteration of the component has the variations, style, additional functionality and accessibility required for my use case | so that I know whether we should update it or not | Designer |
| **Component pipeline** | When using a component, | I want to see if there are any new components or updates in the pipeline | so that I can utilise the component or collaborate with the person who is working on it | Designer |
| **Component development guidance** | When building components, | I want to understand what patterns should be embedded into the component programmatically | so that the component works in the way it was designed. | Developer |
| **design.gitlab, GitLab-ui & figma/sketch sync** | When using a component, | I want to be sure that the component variations, style, additional functionality and accessibility in design.gitlab reflect what is shown in gitlab-ui and figma/sketch | so that I have an accurate representation of what's available and continuity of understanding with other roles in my team | All |
| **Add/edit component** | When reviewing PJs and I see missing/incorrect component content | I would like to add/edit content | so that I contribute to refining our design system | Designer |
| **Integrating component** | When I am integrating a component in our [component lifecycle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/blob/master/doc/component-lifecycle.md) | I want to ... | so that ... | Developers |

## Process

1. **Gather** - Use this issue to collate what the primary the JTBD for designers, devs, PMs, technical writers, researchers
1. **Prioritise** - Prioritise the JTBD to prioritise the content in PJs
1. **Create template** - Create a new content template based on our prioritisation
1. **Create vision mockup** - Create a new vision mockup of what PJs component pages could be

## Additional ideas

- On page table of contents
- Additional tabs
- Changing structure of pages to front-load demos and visual content at top of page
   - First step would be changing component template file: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/master/pages/components/template.md

- Determine a new structure that allows users to easily find the content they are looking for. The end result of this issue should be working page templates and consistent sections and language.",8

86304066,2020-03-18 04:24:58.393,Form help and error text should not be separate,"## Problem

For our form elements, help text and error text are currently defined as two separate text items. This could be confusing as error text could be partially duplicative of the help text. Depending on how the help text is tied to the input for accessibility, this could also add confusion, or cause some info to be missed. Because the help text remains gray, it visually feels disconnected with an input in error state.

## Solution

Help text is a single, dynamic text block with the potential for multiple states.

* By default it is instructional and in a neutral palette
* When an error occurs the help text becomes more explanatory so that a user knows how to correct the error. The danger palette is used.

In this case there is inly one help text block for instruction and error prevention.

31691849,2020-03-06 19:42:44.993,GitLab UI components demos: Reduce style inconsistencies between Storybook and design.gitlab.com,"# What problems are we trying to solve here?

## 1. `.md` styles leaking into GitLab UI components demos

`design.gitlab.com` has a set of typography CSS rules being applied on several common HTML elements in the `.md` scope: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/5f1e9246192f9f04dcd50cefa55985d63c0f88ce/assets/stylesheets/framework/_typography.scss#L35-81

This has been causing issues with components demos as they are being displayed into the same scope, resulting in some components inheriting unexpected CSS rules, an example is the `GlBanner` component: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1620#note_245401786

This has led us to explicitly setting more and more CSS rules in components stylesheets, solely to override `.md` styles. We have tried to circumvent this specific issue by [wrapping components in a custom element](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1737) where GitLab UI styles would be injected in the Shadow DOM. While this solution was promising as it stopped all CSS leak issues, some components like tooltips and popovers aren't Shadow DOM-ready and aren't able to render when they don't have access to the global `document`. More generally, this approach brought us back to problem `#2`.


## 2. Styling elements in the global scope

To prevent GitLab UI's styles from conflicting with `design.gitlab.com`'s styles, we have scoped its styles to the `.app-styles` class: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/5f1e9246192f9f04dcd50cefa55985d63c0f88ce/assets/stylesheets/app.scss#L33-36

This lets us apply components styles locally, without affecting the rest of the website.

This is a sensible approach but we've reached its limits as some components are appending elements to the `body` in the global scope. Since those elements are escaping the `.app-styles` scope, they can't be styled properly, unless we can come up with specific workarounds. For example, we've been able to preserve styles for the `GlModal` component by adding the `.app-styles` class to its wrapper element: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/5f1e9246192f9f04dcd50cefa55985d63c0f88ce/layouts/default.vue#L103-114
There are other cases, like the `GlToast` component, where there is no obvious workaround that we can apply, resulting in a broken looking element in the demo:

![Screen_Shot_2020-03-06_at_3.16.40_PM](/uploads/d1250bfa79c17a6631ea60fb7f46b350/Screen_Shot_2020-03-06_at_3.16.40_PM.png)

Overall, we should try to make it as easy as possible to include components demos in `design.gitlab.com`. Having to come up with workarounds makes for a poor developer experience.

# How can we address these issues?

## 1. Prevent `.md` styles from leaking too deep in the DOM

To prevent `.md` styles from affecting too many of their children, let's make sure that the CSS rules only apply to direct children in `.md`. This will prevent the CSS from leaking into component demos, reducing the need for explicitly setting CSS rules in GitLab UI to override Pajamas' styles.

This approach has a downside: Markdown elements can be nested. For example: `> ### A title in a blockquote`. By applying styles on direct children only, those nested elements will not be styled properly. Since Pajamas doesn't seem to contain any nested Markdown element at the moment, this fix should be acceptable considering its benefits outweigh its disadvantages.

104621769,2022-03-11 14:40:50.808,Discussion: Add guidelines for alternate visual treatment for links,"## Problem

We have the visual treatment for links identified in the GitLab UI, but do not have a dedicated section under Pajamas guidelines to specify them. Today, we treat `copy blue with an underline` as a standard and desired state for links, but from recent feedback on Verify features, we were able to surface a need for multiple visual treatments for the same.

There are pages in the product that list resources, and for their contextual identification it is vital to retain links to associated resources. Example- a pipeline can be best identified in the presence of the commit name/number, branch name, merge request details and triggerer information. Not every user would make use of all of these link, but the personas interacting with these pages are varied and through research we have learn that removing any of these information can prove to be disruptive to a huge number of users.

Presence of many different links as a group, with each demanding user's attention can turn out to be very visually disorienting. To combat this discomfort, we should consider providing different visual treatments to those links. For example - the link that belongs to the resources that is primary to the page can have a blue color, while for the other links we can go for a subdued visual affordance, ma be dark gray with an underline?

We are already doing this on a few pages, such as issues, where we do not give a blue color to link, and at other pages where many different links in a single line have different treatments. To ensure that we provide our users with a coherent experience across platforms, we should document primary and alternate treatments for links and the circumstances under which they should be used. 

### Use cases

I'm listing use-cases from Verify since I'm more versed in those.

#### Pipeline Execution: Pipeline index page

#### Another example of what to avoid:

Links with no affordance inline with plain text. Here, they should have at least an underline, and probably different color too.

| What's a link? | Links |

-----------

### Few consideration highlighted by @jeldergl in a [slack thread](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C010NAWPRV4/p1646921391954459):

> 1. Ensure these are understood as links in context.
> 1. See what can be done to make the gray links look more like a link.
> 1. Be extremely clear when documenting the use case while referencing all of the factors.
> 1. Ensure that what’s decided on and documented here can be abstracted out enough to address similar parts of the UI without creating loopholes.

### Description

As part of an effort to ""unbox"" the GitLab UI (:arrow_forward: [watch a video with more context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxpZuWQH-kk)), the popover component could have a simple update to remove the border between the header and body content and padding. See a similar effort for [unboxing the modal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1221).

**How does this benefit the UI and support unboxing?**

- The popover has hierarchy established with different font weights, the dividing border just reenforces the hierarchy that already exists.
- Similar to the results in the modal, this also allows us to remove the extra padding needed when there are two separate sections, effectively reducing popover height.
- Removing the border between the header and content allows for a more natural reading flow between header and content without the visual break that makes them feel less connected.

103845979,2022-02-28 16:42:53.121,Dropdown > Update styles,"## Background

Dropdowns (trigger button that opens a panel of options) in GitLab historically used a check icon to identify a selection. Awhile ago it was proposed to update to using literal checkbox and radio `<input>`s to better represent the selection (single/multi-select). After more learning around what constitutes options within a dropdown, it' seems's clear that using literal form elements is _not_ ideal and doesn't reflect the semantics for options within a [listbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/listbox_role) or [combobox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/combobox_role).

**Current**

![image](/uploads/6a2018fb1ac333b0f94f7b04c557d8b4/image.png)

## Proposal

Update the design of options within a dropdown panel to represent a selection without using literal form elements. This can be based on the previous design and should include the following states:

- Rest
- Hover (`:hover`)
- Focus (`:focus`)
- Active/pressed (`:active`)
- Selected

Since multi-select is a function of the component and context, and not an individual option (that uses `role=""option""`), the design of an option can be the same for single and multi-select.

**Proposed design**:

![image](/uploads/6002e7764c2aa09e6f495efc19428139/image.png)

- Include a tip pointing to the referring trigger.
- Ensure the panel uses the correct [shadow](https://design.gitlab.com/layout/layers#shadows).
- Use a small :mag: icon in the search input to help with alignment and feel more in scale with the text (might consider this elsewhere in the future too).
- Selected item has rounded rectangle container.
- Border radius increased on panel to keep in proportion to border radius of elements within.
- Left aligned header.
- Option for panel action (to clear all, unassign, etc.).

### Concepts

There's a matrix of options:

- Edge-to-edge option vs. inset rounded rectangle. Space is the primary consideration, but more space could benefit distinguishing options at the cost of a bit more scrolling. The inset rounded rectangle would also be closer to how flyouts are handled in the left navigation.
- Gray vs. blue selected item background. While gray keeps the UI more subdued, the use of blue aligns with our prescribed use to indicate a current or active state and also provides more differentiation with hover states.
- Checkmark vs. border selection indicator. Space is also a consideration here, but what type of indicator makes identifying a selection quick, clear, while not impeding readability is most important.

102039893,2022-02-08 08:08:35.935,Provide guidelines for the usage of Drawers for consistent presentation of in-product Help information,"### Description

Among other things, Drawers are used to present in-product contextual help information in GitLab. We need to provide guidelines for the usage of Drawers for Help information specifically to ensure consistent experience and a certain standard for the formatting and presentation of help info. 

#### Questions to consider

* What are the nuances of using a Drawer for Help information? How can we standardize the design of Help drawers in GitLab?
* What kind of content does / does not belong in the drawer?
* What is the order of types of content?
* Where does the content reside for best updating? Right now, it is hardcoded in the product.
* Requirement for TW to be involved in the Help window content creation (this type of content shouldn't extensively duplicate what is already available (potentially - need to think about this one); should not consist of mostly links; should answer very specific targeted questions, should follow our CTRT design guidelines). For example - the types of content in the CI/CD example are concept, task, tip, reference. Great content and the order is helpful.

This issue is to clarify several questions about the [Drawer component](https://design.gitlab.com/components/drawer/) usage guidelines as surfaced in [this audit. ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/376#note_750204850)

#### Questions to answer

* Should we allow the drawer size to be changed?
* Should the drawer have white or gray background? We have both instances in the product.
* If drawer has a scrollbar, should the width be increased or the usable content area decreased? [Context](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/73955)
* Do drawers have a ""collapsed but still slightly visible"" state? (like our right/left sidebars currently do). Or are they fully visible / fully hidden?
* Can drawers be on the left? Should our sidebars be flipped in RTL layouts (these are more broadly very broken)
* Can drawers be stacked (and overlap slightly)? Or there can be only one at a time. [Context](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338718#note_752946251)

Make updates to the way form components are constructed in the UI kit to reduce the number of component variants. [View the inspiration →](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w0sOpsS90s)

Figma branch [#1235-form-exploration-JE →](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/ubxFCR4pADM7ZfMJ7ZvyOU/Component-library?node-id=3050%3A0)",3
101895697,2022-02-04 15:29:10.292,Add New Popover with Close Button Variant to Pajamas,"<!--
Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”

101227845,2022-01-25 15:12:14.168,Empty search results vs empty filter results empty state text guidance,"### Description

We added some documentation around empty search results recently in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1210. When I used them for https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339525/designs/Deleted-many-items.png#note_820337312, they didn't quite fit since there were filters applied. There are cases when something is searched within a search input field that will result in no matches, as well as when something is filtered within the filter component that can also result in no matches. We should decide whether or not we want to provide different messaging for those.

<!-- Add a short description of the documentation addition or update. Remember to say why, not just what. -->

### Audit of empty state cases

| Summary |
| ------ |
| Whether we use a search component to filter down results, or the filter component, we do not consistently provide messages as to why there were no matches. |

👉 When using the filter component, `7/17` instances use something similar to the following text:
 
**Sorry, your filter produced no results**

To widen your search, change or remove filters above

👉 When using the search component, `only 3/10` instances use something similar to the following text:
 
**Sorry, no projects matched your search**

100940753,2022-01-19 21:57:24.167,UI kit > Update checkbox and radio components,"## Purpose

- Update components to make better use of variants.
- Add indeterminate (checkboxes only and disabled states.

### Reference

There's an [existing Figma branch](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/branch/zuwBQHtdwn2KALwuKRuvvB/Component-library), but it's a bit far behind the main and there are some other approaches to explore so a new branch is preferred.

Here's an example of what's there though:

100450014,2022-01-11 18:37:05.300,Text guidance for blank state,"We don't have consistent text in our blank state pages in the UI. We need to create guidance and apply it.

Related to: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339525/designs/Deleted-many-items.png#note_807219530

If you look at the following examples, the most effective ones have a call to action.

Should there be different text, based on the type of page? For example, does it make sense to have a call to action on a search or filter page that shows no results?

## Current guidance

I found this info in Pajamas:

* https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states
* https://design.gitlab.com/regions/empty-states#blank-content

And there is an empty state template: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Empty%20state

It does define different types of blank state pages:

- Blank page with a call to action
- Configuration required
- Higher tier required
- Empty search results

We should recommend text for each.

## Examples of empty state pages

The following are just random examples from the UI.

99922200,2021-12-30 13:57:34.199,Pajamas UI Kit > Add optional prop to form label,"## Purpose

Form labels can have ""(optional)"" appended to them. It uses a different text style and would be useful to include as an option in Figma similar to how it is in GitLab UI. The text remains editable.

Toggling the optional property in GitLab UI:

The [initial implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2447) migrated alerts and banners to use this new approach, but several other pages are still using legacy examples and implementation tabs. Let's migrate remaining pages, the only pre-requisite being that the corresponding GitLab UI component(s) must have been migrated to the Component Story Format (https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5651).

## Migration steps

* [ ] In the `.md` file:
    * [ ] Migrate the `vueComponents` property to `stories` in the frontmatter.
    * [ ] Migrate `[[Example:*]]` tags to `[[Story:*]]` tags.

98849054,2021-12-10 18:27:17.578,UI kit > Update components to light icons,"## Purpose

With https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/issues/178 getting implemented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/739 we can update the icons in the Pajamas UI Kit.

The new icons will be maintained in a separate file from the component library for easier maintenance and sharing.

**Steps**

1. [x] Ensure all icons that weren't updated in the recent effort, but are still part of the library, are included in the new icon file. For example, pipeline, issue type, and brand icons.
1. [x] Publish the new icon library and add it to our community page.
1. [x] Replace the icons in the component library with the ones from the new icon library.
1. [x] Deprecate the old icons by removing them from the component library and placing into a separate file that will be archived.
1. [x] Publish an updated version of the component library.
1. [x] Mention the breaking change in the UX Weekly with directions on using the new library.
1. [x] Create a new MR to update the iconography guidelines in Pajamas.",2

The current layer shadow style/specs in the UI kit ([modal example](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=4263%3A22)) don't align with what's in [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/layout/layers#large).

## Solution

Consolidated list of styles based on components in production and in the UI kit

## Shadow styles

### Small shadow - {+new+}

| GitLab-ui | GitLab UI kit | Components | CSS |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| $gl-shadow-sm | Small $gl-shadow-sm | Card | `box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);` | 

### Medium shadow - {+new+}

| GitLab-ui | GitLab UI kit | Components | CSS |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| $gl-shadow-md | Medium $gl-shadow-md | Date picker, Dropdown, Menus, Flyout Nav, Card `on_drag` | `box-shadow: 0px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0px 0px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16);` | 

### Large shadow

| GitLab-ui | GitLab UI kit | Components | CSS |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| $gl-shadow-lg | Large $gl-shadow-lg | Modal, Drawer | `box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16), 0px 0px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16);` | 



## Changes for this issue

### UI Kit

- [x] Add missing shadow layer styles (sm & md)
- [x] Update the shadow-sm to be more appropriate for the card on boards.

### Pajamas

- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new styles
- [ ] Update images to follow `visual example` patterns

## GitLab UI

### In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/615

1. Document new shadow styles and audit existing styles
1. Add new shadow styles as utility classes
1. Update instances to use the new GitLab UI utility classes

```
Out of scope but worth mentioning; 

* gl-shadow-focus: focus states

This will remain unchanged in Gitlab-UI

>Correct me if I’m wrong, but we still have to update Pajamas examples to match GitLab UI stories, right? As I’ve been working through the accessibility audits, my assumption is that any change to the component in GitLab UI will mean that updates have to happen in Pajamas too. Any ideas on being able to have one live example SSoT?

Generally at the moment I think just about everything could be affected since one version exists in Storybook in either example or CSF format, and there'd be an example in Pajamas.

Recent example since I was working on auditing breadcrumbs. The separator isn't the same…

95106896,2021-10-08 12:16:48.525,Create an Object issue template,"## 🧩 Problem

We've started documenting objects in Pajamas (see the [MR object](https://design.gitlab.com/objects/merge-request)). Currently we don't have any contribution guidelines for documenting objects. For someone unfamiliar with the purpose and process of object modeling it can be intimidating and difficult to get started.

The conceptual object model becomes more useful as more objects and layouts are documented since it helps communicate the relationships between different objects. The more objects and layouts we document (even if the model is imperfect at first), the more we'll be able to use it. For example, it can help identify important object relationships and ensure we don't overlook them in our design work.

## 💡 Proposal

We don't need to create a perfect set of guidelines and templates to start benefiting from the documented model. The objective is to create an MVC set of guidelines and resources to get more product designers interested in contributing.

This issue will focus on adding an Object issue template to guide designers as they document the conceptual model and the layouts for the object.",2

Start by choosing one of the following based on the nature of your contribution:
   - For changes to an existing file, duplicate the general template (https://www.figma.com/file/v7I3e2CqmRagoi5jSzjROQ/Title-group-project-1337) to the UX Foundations Figma project (https://www.figma.com/files/project/8421515/UX-Foundation). Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”). Make changes in the working file to detached instances of a component, or copy/paste from designs in the original (target) file.
   - For additions, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. For example, a file making a change to the component library would belong in the UX Foundations project. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.

Recently the [text input base](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/Component-library?node-id=43905%3A45856) was updated to include prefix and suffix options while the add-ons remained unchanged. This issue addresses making the add-ons easier to change and update in a similar way.

![CleanShot_2021-09-14_at_13.40.09_2x](/uploads/42ee6804da0c816a098adda02d456ca1/CleanShot_2021-09-14_at_13.40.09_2x.png)

## Scope

Create a branch of the component library **❖ _Base Add-on** component with the following variants:

- Character count
- Clear button ([clear](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~clear) icon) to clear entered content
- Show button ([eye](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~eye) icon) for password visibility
- Hide button ([eye-slash](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~eye-slash)) for obscuring password
- Calendar button ([calendar](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-svgs/?q=~calendar) icon) for date picker

The character count can be present with the buttons, but only one button can be visible at a time.

**Additional changes:**

- The add-ons in the **❖ _Base Field** component will be replaced with the **❖ _Base Add-on** component.
- Currently the add-ons are set to true/false for the **Text input** component and will need to be changed to a dropdown to choose the type of add-on. The **Text area** component can remain as true/false as long as the character count is the only option.
- All component variants will need to be updated to look the same as they do today, only they will have the correct add-on chosen by default. This applies to everything in **Forms**, as well as **Datepicker** and **Dropdown**.

Based on https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2520#note_671632056.

Two main questions:

1. What state of the component should be the structure image? For example:

| Beginning | All possible elements (Base component) |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.12_AM](/uploads/5440df806d6010c37e7b7c6e7976faa7/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.12_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM](/uploads/b6745b7566efb4ffa2cd2548ee6d173d/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM.png) |

Which should be the structure image? My assumption is to use the base component so we can describe each possible visible element. 

2. Should we include multiple structure images if there are different variants? For example:

| Single file uploader | Multi file uploader |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM](/uploads/9e2089c97144d8f97abcf4d75babf39d/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.35.18_AM.png) | ![Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.37.34_AM](/uploads/1d2c201ce6b8bbadb557d5ec17d76a97/Screen_Shot_2021-09-14_at_10.37.34_AM.png) | 

Again, my assumption is we include both, with unique lists for each. Thoughts?",1

Also, the stacking order infers who was added when. If someone was added later, it makes sense that their avatar is set on top of the one before.

## Solution

Continue to order the avatars from left to right, but as they're ordered from left to right, they should stack from bottom to top. This allows the badge (if present) to be the most visible item and have the largest click target when interactive.

When DOM order and z-index is considered I believe this is a more natural presentation too.

As a result of the audit in the parent epic, the focus ring visual styles should be reviewed to consider the following:

- Increase focus ring contrast to at least 3:1 (currently 1.97:1).
- While I believe that there is no current failure because for [SC 2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible) there is a visible focus ring, and for [SC 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast) the button text and/or icon has sufficient contrast, there are potential updates per the [WCAG 2.2 Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) that we could aim to satisfy now.

91809050,2021-08-11 12:09:41.126,Elevate contribution to a tab,"How can we increase and invite contribution to Pajamas in a ""boring solution"" kind of way?

Inspired by the **Discussion** tab in https://designsystem.gov.au/components/buttons/discussion/ (thanks @mle for tweeting about this site, it's awesome) I'm exploring a **Contribute** tab.

What would go in there?

- A bit of a text preamble with a link to the **Getting started > Contribute** page.
- We already have links in the footer to related issues and merge requests. It'd be worth repeating here when either are available.
- Occasional links to research efforts, polls, questionnaires, hackathons, etc. It'd be great to have some passive, evergreen items like that where someone could provide feedback.

What does this solve?

- Reenforcing that ""everyone can contribute,"" while creating more visibility on how.
- What I especially liked about the Australian Government Design System example is how I felt invited into the conversation. It wasn't just one-way information. It also felt very transparent to reference discussion happening behind the scenes that you might normally not be privy to.

At the moment, links in the markdown content are not underlined and have low contrast next to static text. This makes it more difficult to discern a link from surrounding text.

A boring solution is simply to leverage the default `text-decoration: underline` for links within markdown.

## Proposed state

* Use a common grid to layout the illustration — one for large and one for medium (no small identified as empty states in the current illustration library).
* Have a consistent focal-point. Leverage the grid and some keylines to help with object placement.
* Use a consistent color palette for the focal-point element(s).
* Establish guides on when to create a more custom illustration, and when to leverage something that's multi-purpose or more generic. For example, a more custom illustration could be created with a combination of new and existing assets for a new feature or one that isn't enabled, while an empty data state or configuration needed could always use the same asset.

### Repeating themes

- Upgrade
- Not configured

When working through some Pajamas research related to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/541, I noticed that the concept of button categories and variants was confusing for users. I still mull it over from time to time too. I’m wondering if perhaps we could reconsider the hierarchy of information here to simplify it?

| **Category:**<br>- Primary<br>- Secondary<br>- Tertiary<br><br>**Variants:**<br>- Confirm<br>- Default<br>- Dashed<br>- Danger<br>- Link | **Variants:**<br>- Confirm<br>&nbsp;  - Primary<br>&nbsp;  - Secondary<br>&nbsp;  - Tertiary<br>- Default<br>&nbsp;  - _Same pattern as Confirm_<br>- … |

This would focus on the variants, and then the options for each variant. I think doing away with the category content as-is would be helpful. We can still identify primary, secondary, and tertiary actions, but secondary to variant. We could always take naming further, but a change like this doesn't require component changes as far as I can tell, just how it's presented.",3

While the Pajamas documentation provides extensive examples and code snippets for our components, there is currently no easy way to try our design system without installing GDK or creating a GitPod instance.

### Proposal 

This issue proposes adding a Pajamas Playground to our documentation (potentially as a simple iframe), to remedy this gap and enable designers & developers to:

- Quickly try component code directly in the browser
- Test different component props and combinations
- Easily collaborate and generate code snippets for other developers

**Question for the Foundations Team**: Do you see this as something useful and worth integrating into the docs?

### Possible Next steps

The proof of concept above is a very rough prototype, and it can likely break very easily. Possible next steps to integrate this as an official part of our tooling include:

- Embed playground in a dedicated page of Pajamas docs
- Update code to dynamically import the latest version of _every_ Pajamas component (including new ones)
- Add sharing button to append current code to URL -- see [example on Auth0 docs](https://auth0-cosmos.vercel.app/#/playground)

89489145,2021-06-29 15:26:55.709,Add bot warning for workflow label and weight,"## Purpose

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/850 the UX Foundations team is working on adding workflow labels and weights to each issue. When a new issue is created there's no way for the author to know that a workflow label and weight should be added.

The proposal is to have a bot notify the author to add the workflow label or weight, or to automatically add a label.

Message:

```
Hi @[AUTHOR],

Please add a [workflow label](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/) and [weight](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-designer/#ux-weight-definitions) to your issue. This helps to categorize and locate issues in the future.

Thanks for your help! :heart:

89416050,2021-06-28 14:55:53.428,Pajamas competitor analysis,"This issue is to discuss the possibility for doing competitor analysis for Pajamas. I think it will be valuable to do a lightweight version of the UX competitor analysis to gain insight into how we can continue to improve Pajamas, by taking a look at some other design systems. 

I think we have the opportunity to do something from scratch, I have heard from multiple designers that the current competitor analysis in UX is too in depth, perhaps we look at developing our own from scratch that's much simpler. 

- [ ] Determine whether doing a competitor analysis is useful 
  - [ ] Determine how a formal competitor analysis will be structured",1
88894335,2021-06-17 16:53:34.548,Where should research insights live that impacts Pajamas?,"## Purpose

In a recent 1:1 I brought up the idea of using the wiki feature in the Pajamas project to house research insights and more conversational reasoning behind decisions that impact components. From each component page we could link to the relevant section of the wiki.

This brought up the need to address a few questions at a higher level before solutioning:

- Where should research live and how should it be incorporated into Pajamas (if at all)?
- Is there still an insights repo that could be linked to?

Currently, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2414 as part of the component page template update a new ""Reference"" section is being added with the intent to add links and commentary.

The component page documentation should be direct, and we don't want to add to the overhead by having research links throughout that might be private or change. So where could we have a SSoT and how should we reference it?",1

126941915,2023-04-19 20:09:02.337,Labels and linking,"## Purpose

>>In this context, the text “Code owners” isn't explicit that it navigates to the code owners file, because it's also used as a label for the list of code owners of the current file.
> 
> @pedroms I think this is a great point and something we should evaluate — should a label be allowed to link? And how does visual label relate to `label` (which wouldn't necessarily make sense in this context)? At the moment this text only visually appears as a label, and nothing about it, other than the preceding ':' indicates as much, which is why I'm inclined to proceed.

Per the discussion in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/117251#note_1353052885, this issue is to discuss the following:

- Should text that _appears_ as a label (although isn't actually a `label`) be allowed to link?
  - If yes, what link variant is most appropriate?

For example, the ""Code owners"" text in the following screenshot.

![CleanShot_2023-04-19_at_15.11.48_2x](/uploads/dadb264ad9c9ed05fe91fca0e7abd923/CleanShot_2023-04-19_at_15.11.48_2x.png)

Decrease the min-width of the dropdown by 8px (16rem → 15.5rem) so that it fits within the new sidebar navigation.

This would have minimal, if any, impact on existing instances and may even slightly improve some where all option text is short.

# Proposed link styles

The following documents the intention, rather than the prescription for the actual CSS to be used.

Class names placeholder to make it easier to read.

There are certainly better ways to achieve the same thing.

[Play with the styles in context in this codepen](https://codepen.io/danmh/pen/rNZGKbm).

```scss

// Inline links assumed the default

a {
  color: $blue-700;
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-color: rgba($blue-700, .72);   // allows underline tone to match background
  text-underline-offset: 2px;                    // we should make this a relative value, 
                                                 // as it breaks when the browser font size is changed 
  transition: background-color 100ms linear, color 100ms linear,
               border 100ms linear, text-decoration-color 100ms linear; 
                                                 // builds on existing link transition styles, adds text-decoration-color
  
  &:hover {
    color: $blue-800;
    text-decoration: underline !important;       // allows other link types to have underline on hover
                                                 // even if they have text-decoration: none for the rest state
    text-decoration-color: currentColor;
  }
  
  &:focus-visible {
    color: $blue-800;
    text-decoration: underline !important;
    text-decoration-color: currentColor;
    outline: 2px solid #428fdc;   // existing focus styles
    outline-offset: 2px;          // existing focus styles
  }
  
  &:active {
    color: $blue-900;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-color: currentColor;
    transition: none;             // makes the click or press feel snappy
  }
}

a.ui-link {
  text-decoration: none;          // no underline in rest state
}

a.meta-link {
  text-decoration: none;
  
  &.meta-link-dark {
    color: $grey-900;
    &:hover {color: $grey-950;}
    &:active {color: $black;}

124074239,2023-02-21 18:18:30.834,Breadcrumb component updates,"# Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb is a component that is less isolated than other components because it’s navigation based on the page it’s within, and is bound by the layout and behavior constructs of that page along with other content and functionality.

Updates to the breadcrumb can’t happen without considering the impact to its own UX, and to the UX of the page in which it’s placed. For that reason, there are two parallel categories of considerations that have to be addressed: component-specific, and the relationship with other elements.

## Component-specific

<details><summary>View details</summary>

- Responsive - Wrapping and truncation
	- Truncation based on width or character count? Both?
	- Where truncation occurs in the string?
	- At wider views, should we allow larger strings to be expanded, potentially creating an unwieldy string in primary real estate? 
- States
	- Interactive states, such as hover and focus
	- Current page state
- Design spec updates (border, separator, states, etc.)
- Semantics and [accessibility updates](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6879) for current implementation
- Migration

**Deliverables:**

- [Updated design specs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1533)
- Updated Pajamas documentation
- Component updates in GitLab UI
- Component migration

</details>

## Relationship with other elements

<details><summary>View details</summary>

- **[Navigation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/issues/2141) — specifically the sidebar show/hide icon placement and behavior (priority)**
- DOM order with other elements, like alerts, banners, and broadcast messages
- Within [headers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/3263)
	- Sticky behavior
	- Page actions
- Fluid and fixed width layout settings

**Deliverables:**

- **Navigation + breadcrumb requirements and specs (priority)**
- Identify and document potential patterns that use a breadcrumb
- Updated Pajamas documentation

The tertiary buttons use `mix-blend-mode: multiply` ([source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/main/src/components/base/button/button.scss#L326)) to keep contrast consistent when on different background colors. This updates them in the UI kit to match.

<!--
- For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
- For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
- For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”

122318319,2023-01-23 17:42:41.455,Dropdown > Update design spec to include min/max width,"## Purpose

Based on the implementation plan in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1507#implementation-plan, the **dropdown** design specs should be updated to include the recommended minimum and maximum widths.

This doesn't have to be a component setting, but that is an option if the configuration is easy enough to implement and the design experience isn't impacted.

## Specs

Make dropdown's width more flexible:

* [x] min-width: 16rem (256px)
* [x] max-width: 28.5rem (456px)
* [x] max-height: 19.5rem (312px)",2
121186565,2023-01-03 19:31:36.320,Broadcast message > Update variants and instances,"## Description

Updating the broadcast message component in Figma to:

- Better account for fixed vs. fluid layout behavior.
  - Max-width (954px) is calculated based on the [990px fixed width](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/layout#fixed-layout) minus 16px margin on each side.
- Add description for each variants. Description is visible in the properties panel when an instance is selected.
- Add ability to toggle × close icon.
- Add instances for different states and [example] themes.
- Remove unnecessary todo and note.

The changes are modeled after what's currently in place for the [alert component](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/%F0%9F%93%99-Component-library?node-id=425%3A1&t=zd18xI1uNlssCjAi-11).

- [ ] `GlCollapsibleListbox`
  - [ ] Make dropdown's width more flexible:
    - [ ] `min-width: 15rem`

  - [ ] Leverage `GlTruncate` to truncate long items' names. This should be probably be the consumer's responsibility, so this can be a recommendation in the docs.

120174557,2022-12-09 19:05:39.341,Figma > Tooltip – Update tooltip component to resize based on content,"## Description

The tooltip component currently doesn't resize based on content. Additionally, if you change the tip position, the content isn’t persisted. See [discussion in Slack](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CNDGX396C/p1670605977187449) and example:

![Kapture_2022-12-09_at_11.12.03](/uploads/365dd3e332c3d83c3144d6906a2420af/Kapture_2022-12-09_at_11.12.03.mp4)

We should update the component to fix these issues.

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding
a checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross reference everything that has been completed. -->

<!--
- For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
- For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
- For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”

118936476,2022-11-17 19:57:44.973,Button > Add note about icon indicating action,"## Purpose

Icon only buttons shouldn't act as a toggle where the icon might change depending on state. For example, ![eye.svg](/uploads/8d7f9c533374ec1ef07ab58fcfbc184f/eye.svg) changing to ![eye-slash.svg](/uploads/c8cdb864cae90e67f1534b8d2f527f92/eye-slash.svg) on click because the state can be confusing. Does it mean that the current state is A and clicking goes to B, or the opposite?

This issue is to initiate documenting the recommendation.",1
118776570,2022-11-15 22:42:35.204,Update severity guides for errors,"## Purpose

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/contents/usability/error-prevention.md?plain=1#L13 there's reference to old button content that can be updated. Along with the the entire section will reviewed to make sure it's accurate.

>The destructive action can easily be undone and no actual data was lost. Consider adding no friction at all in order to streamline the interface, especially in places where the action needs to be performed in bulk. These kinds of destructive actions can be exempt of being **[elementary](/components/button/#elementary) styled and can instead be [neutral](/components/button/#neutral) styled buttons.** (Emphasis added)",1
118773554,2022-11-15 21:26:13.349,Pajamas navigation refinements,"## Purpose

A followup from #1443 to further refine the navigation with the following:

- Update the Pajamas lockup and ensure a common left edge (alignment) for all elements.
- Ability to expand multiple sections at once. This is a common accordion-like pattern that would allow a user to compare the options in different sections. While this UX might not be ideal for some sites, it can be a benefit for a user of Pajamas to get a better understanding why there are **Form elements** in one section, and **Forms** in another.
- Sticky expanded sections. Since some sections (like **Components**) are quite long, having the parent category item sticky when expanded can help a user maintain context for the current section they're navigating.
- Update design of search to be more integrated into the sidebar (inspired by the recent update to the dropdown design).

117759458,2022-10-28 14:26:52.192,Tint neutral palette based on brand,"## Purpose

In the latest brand updates the brand palette includes neutrals that are slightly more cool (blue) in tone. The current Pajamas neutral palette is completely desaturated and feels more generic than it could. There have been previous efforts to explore introducing both a cool and warm set of neutrals to compliment the current ones, however it became clear that this would be to try and account for the current theme approach (warm neutrals with red theme for example), and add unnecessary complexity to an already minimally used feature.

Having a neutral palette that skews more towards the temperature of the brand palette will provide more continuity between digital properties and subtly allow us to infuse more of the brand into Pajamas and the product. Given our use of blue for primary actions and links, a more cool palette also helps elements to feel more harmonious. 

## Proposal

Update the neutral palette to align with the grays in the brand palette.

|  | **Palette** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Brand | ![image](/uploads/415a82d85c280e978fcf32218e192bd4/image.png) |

**Other thoughts…**

Yes, this is subjective and nuanced. When exploring navigation updates both in the product, and Pajamas, designers have noted that the current neutrals are just too flat. We have an opportunity to better align the recent brand work and the product, and this is a very subtle, but effective way to do so.

A cool neutral palette could also benefit dark UI and ironically (ignoring the terms) prevent it from feeling too cold or bland. [From this article](https://compilezero.medium.com/dark-mode-ui-design-the-definitive-guide-part-1-color-53dcfaea5129):

> …you could also use accented neutrals instead of a pure-grey palette, which I personally recommend using due to 2 main reasons,
> 
> _Pure greys are not found naturally, and so its a good option to have some tint on those neutrals to give it a more natural vibe._
> 
> _Tinted neutrals, could help give the UI an overall emphasized tone and emotion to look forward to._

116774125,2022-10-12 18:24:03.009,Dropdown > Update docs to align with latest approach,"## Purpose

As a next iteration we've discussed moving the listbox to a low-level component. What that means is that it isn't something to be used on it's own as an actual dropdown variant, but instead it's consumed by both the disclosure (optional) and combobox (required).

Likewise, it's been determined that the menu variant isn't something we'll proceed with for now since the disclosure can fir the use cases we have today in the product.

## Changes

- Place necessary listbox content within the [combobox](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-combobox) page.
- Deprecate the [listbox](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-listbox) page.
- From the [disclosure](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-disclosure) page, link to the new listbox section under combobox as the SSoT.
- Deprecate the [menu](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-menu) page.
- Consider adding decision trees in the _when to use_ section(s) to help determine what to use.

The above changes would leave us with only the disclosure and combobox dropdown variants. To avoid the use of a menu-like option, we could consider adding a line about what `role= menu` is and why we don't use it in both places.",1

Given that noone seems to have looked at Analytics in a while (at least when I asked), we should consider removing it and making our lives easier.",1

There's a need to add an empty state to the `Scheduled pipeline` page for which this illustration will come in handy.

116091745,2022-09-30 18:49:41.164,Discovery > Look into possibilities of displaying ViewComponents in Pajamas,"Now that we have [ViewComponents](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8113), it would be great to get those displayed in Pajamas alongside the Vue components. 

As a first iteration, the `Implementation` tab could change to `Vue` and we could introduce a new tab per component called `View`.

One potential hurdle is that it needs to properly deployed to a Rails application, so we need to determine if this is possible or what options we have.

113719597,2022-08-23 18:36:18.708,Introduce option to put selected items at top of dropdown,"## Problem to solve

Without a dropdown pattern that shows the selected items at the top, I can't see what those selections are without a lot of scrolling in the dropdown. The truncation in the button suggests that there are more items, but how do I know what these are? Example from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345430/designs/Runner_tag_field_states.png#note_1074738137:

<img src=""/uploads/411cf209d509257ec56bdc8b8214ee2a/Screen_Shot_2022-08-23_at_2.08.30_PM.png"" width=""40%"">

I'd have to scroll down through potentially hundreds of items to see what the `+2 more` refers to (and/or to unselect them). Sometimes the dropdown doesn't even show the complete list, which makes it impossible to find it unless I know what I'm looking for and can use the search to find it (and unselect it, for example). 

## Proposal

| 5 items | 6+ items creates a scrollable area |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![image](/uploads/a0519c2f232eda7f84a57b3205f35b41/image.png) | ![image](/uploads/6a4c06a5df719deb4aa02635991d0dac/image.png) |

In order to prevent the selection from moving around within the input, which could be a frustrating and disorienting experience, the selection should move _after_ the dropdown is closed so it's shown when it's re-opened. This is different than how it currently works in the Assignees dropdown.

Example:

As far as I can tell, this type of dropdown isn't available in [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/components/dropdown-listbox), [gitlab-ui](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-dropdown--default), or the Figma library as a variant (only as an [instance](https://www.figma.com/file/qEddyqCrI7kPSBjGmwkZzQ/%F0%9F%93%99-Component-library?node-id=12053%3A6)).",5

112728442,2022-08-03 13:35:05.333,Typography > Note smallest recommended font size,"## Purpose

Some instances of type are showing up that are smaller than the 12px allowed by the current type scales (UI type scale). 12px is a good minimum size and should be used in limited capacity for short meta-like copy and actions. There is no minimum mentioned in Pajamas (although it's implied by the type scale styles), and it'd be helpful to document.

There is subjectivity when it comes to font size and preference, but that's all the more reason to set a baseline and guidance. For example, browsers handle antialiasing differently and rendering ""quality"" will vary. GitLab makes use of system fonts, and some, like Helvetica, have tighter spacing and less character definition so that text is harder to read at small sizes. One user will not have the same eyesight as the next, so setting a minimum can also help remove subjectivity and preference for what should be the minimum size.

If content is worth displaying, then it should be worth displaying legibly.

### Considerations

- On mobile, if the font size of an input is not at least 16px, then input will be scaled up (at least in Safari).
- Typeface, font weight, color, line-height, measure, and style can all impact legibility.
- While WCAG doesn't prescribe a minimum font size, it does address contrast for type
- Pixels are referenced as the unit in this issue, but in code relative units should be used so that a user can scale the type in browser (using pixels prevents this). If a browser's default size is 16px (1rem), then 12px = 0.75rem.
- Screen resolution will impact legibility.

See [epic description](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/-/epics/12).

## Steps

- [ ] Conduct an internal survey to better understand what perceived gaps are.
- [ ] Triage open issues to determine what topics and items are most commonly discussed.
  - [ ] Create sub-epics or new issues to organize by theme.
- [ ] Identify gaps in Pajamas design language. These are the areas that need clarified in order for anyone to have confidence and continuity when building an experience using the design system. For example, I know what component A does, but do I know how to use it with component B, or in a scenario where multiple components exist?
- [ ] Make proposals to close gaps.

## Before / after

<details><summary>Definitions</summary>

### Definitions

|  | **Before** | **After** |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Foundations** | Foundations represent perceptual patterns. These are less tangible aspects of the design system. Together they create a certain aesthetic for the product. For example, colors, typography, and icons. | Foundational items communicate the opinionated way in which basic visual design attributes, elements, and concepts come together to create a distinct GitLab personality that’s expressed in the UI. For example, color, typography, and iconography. |
| **Components** | A small design primitive. Components build upon the design foundations (typography, spacing, motion, colors, iconography, etc.) and are the reusable building blocks of the interface. For example, buttons, tabs, and input fields. | A component is a UI element that serves a singular purpose or function. Two or more simple components can combine to form a composite component that still has a single function. For example, an avatar, button, or combobox. |
| **Regions** | Regions are areas formed by combining multiple components, creating a layout section that can be reused across various pages. For example, the comments and activity feed in issues or merge requests. | _Deprecated_ |
| **Patterns** | _N/A_ | A pattern combines components and/or content elements into a repeatable, consistent group that has a shared purpose, content association, or both. For example, filtering, forms, or navigation. |
| **Page templates** | _N/A_ | A template prescribes layout and behavior for a page or common content layout. For example, an issuable, settings, or search results. |
| **Objects** | Objects capture and organize data as a single source of truth around specific tasks and user interactions. Objects are described in terms of attributes (what they contain), functions (what they do), and relationships (what they interact with). When documented as a conceptual model, objects help understand how the product works and fits together on a system level, detached from the constraints of the user interface. An effective object model tightly aligns our user's mental model with the product's data model. For example, issue, group, and merge request. | An object is a conceptual building block or concept that defines how we think about something independent of its visual representation or interaction model. For example, a job, merge request, or repository. |

110124885,2022-06-14 23:01:49.627,"Draft: Pajamas scaffolding, structure, and ops","## Purpose

Pajamas provides foundational styles and element, component guidelines, abstracted objects, and UX content, but it's less clear on how to assemble all of these disparate parts. It's these middle guiding layers of the design system that need built out to provide more visual design direction and UI consistency when it comes to implementation.

At the same time, Pajamas needs a common vernacular with agreed upon definitions and categorization. For example, terms like ""patterns,"" ""organisms,"" and ""regions"" mean different things to everyone and time spent aligning on meaning stifles additions and system maturity. A large part of the initial effort will be to refine the GitLab design language and provide the consistent groundwork that efforts like ""unboxing"" and ""beautification"" — and future ones like them — need to stand on. Pajamas is not just _what_, but _how_, and this is what it means to have a design language and not just a design system. 

## Phases

1. **Pajamas scaffolding** (%""15.2"")
   - Definitions
   - Website / design system IA and content mapping
   - Gap analysis:
     - Gaps in Pajamas design language
     - Gaps between Pajamas and product
2. **Pajamas structure** (TBD)
   - Website updates: Implement IA changes
   - SSoT: What would it take to make the Pajamas site the go-to?
3. **PajamasOps** (TBD)
   - Storybook: Playground, features, robust layouts, accessibility testing
   - Figma: Internal plugins, designer efficiency
   - Triage and contributions
   - Prioritization

## Outcomes

- Consistency in design execution and user experience
- Shared design language
- More informed decisions and contribution
- Pajamas → Product planning and prioritization

## Considerations

- Pajamas documentation should be prescriptive when necessary, and guiding when not. The aim is not to have a draconian system, but one that provides meaningful constraints to foster collaboration, provide clear and informed guidance, and inspire new possibilities.
- Refining the design language gives space for efforts like tokenizing and theming to have a meaningful place.
- Gap analysis helps to define not only what areas need building out, but also the size and impact of gaps between Pajamas and the product. For example, typography is foundational, but not consumed by the product.

110053010,2022-06-13 21:07:54.979,Illustration > Add XS grid size,"## Purpose

A new extra small (XS) grid is being added to provide a size that illustration elements can be created at when they're used alongside other UI or to comprise part of a larger design.

For example, in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/794 a ""bidirectional-xs"" illustration is being added to connect two logos. Because of our third-party trademark policy we didn't want to add this to one of the logos or combine them. The 72px grid here would've been too large in relation to the logos and placed emphasis in the wrong place.

36px was chosen instead of 32px (and base 8) in order to follow the illustration pattern where each size increases at 2x.",1
109899028,2022-06-10 08:01:19.741,Color > Adjust $gray-10 from #fafafa to #f5f5f5,"## Description

This is a follow-up to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87817 & https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/89533.

This is a proposal to adjust the `$gray-10` we have defined in the Pajamas Design System to a bit darker nuance.
FYI: In the product we use a `$gray-normal` which is actally using the same HEX value as this proposed darker nuance.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2868 we will update `$gray-10` for GitLab UI.

### Proposal

Let's add the following gray's to GitLab UI:

| $gray10 before | $gray10 after |
| ------ | ------ |
| `#fafafa` | `#f5f5f5` |

109401960,2022-05-31 18:45:35.428,Clarify in Pajamas whether a successful save should be an alert or a toast,"### Problem to solve

We use an info alert on the user settings page to confirm a change, but elsewhere (e.g. the Vulnerability Report), after a successful bulk action, we use a toast notification to confirm the change has been made. 

On the [alerts](https://design.gitlab.com/components/alert/#when-to-use) page, Pajamas says:
> Reaffirm to the user that a prior action, likely in a different location or context, has been successful.

""When to use"" on the [toast](https://design.gitlab.com/components/toast/#when-to-use) page, on the other hand, says:
> Provide a contextual message based on a user's action in the same view the action took place.

### Proposal

With all the types of alerts we can have in one area at one time (error, warning, etc) in some places, especially the security tab of the pipeline page (see designs in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352880#note_961677263), we should use toast notifications to confirm a saved change. 

Either way, we should update the Pajamas docs accordingly (toast, alert, and [Instant Feedback](https://design.gitlab.com/product-foundations/saving-and-feedback#instant-feedback)) to be more clear which is the suggested pattern.",3

<!-- Add a short description of your contribution. Consider adding
a checklist of variations, states, and breakpoints to the description so that reviewers can be sure to cross reference everything that has been completed. -->

<!--
- For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
- For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
- For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

To move a duplicate file:
Open the duplicate, then use the dropdown next to the file name to select
“Move to Project…” and select the desired project as the new location. The duplicate is now the “working file.”

- **When:** June 10, 2022
- **Who:** Everyone! FE, BE, Designers, Product, etc. Everyone is encouraged to contribute.
- **Where:** Your very own home or work space, but also join the `#pajamas_migration_day` slack channel to hang out and chat with fellow contributors!
- **Why:** We want to encourage a day of migrating legacy components / css to use Pajamas!
- **Bonus:** If you contribute three merge requests on Pajamas Migration Day, you can expense a meal for up to $25 USD! Please use the ~""Pajamas Migration Day"" label on your MRs to be eligible. In Expensify, use the `Meals Company Provided (Non-Client related)` category.

**Need help?** Ping any member of the [Foundations team](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/?department=ecosystem-foundations-team) for support or help throughout the day. We are here to assist!

## How to contribute

- ~~[Migrate a few angle icons to chevrons →](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8087)~~ All assigned
- Or if you like buttons more than chevrons :see_no_evil:  - you can pick one of the [Haml/Ruby button to Pajamas::ButtonComponent migrations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8153)
- ~~There are also a couple of [""banners"" to migrate to `Pajamas::BannerComponent`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8076) ViewComponent.~~ All assigned
- Treat migration day like a scavenger hunt! Review the product and find components/legacy CSS and update it to align with Pajamas!
- Pick up any issue that that is [ready for development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=pajamas%3A%3Aintegrate&label_name%5B%5D=OKR&assignee_id=None&first_page_size=20).

There does not need to be a specific issue open to contribute! Starting with MRs that migrate legacy code is a great way to contribute to the effort.

**Reminder:** Please add the ~""Pajamas Migration Day"" label to your MRs, as well as the specific component label that relates to your change (for example: ~""component:alert"")",1

108680374,2022-05-17 12:38:53.806,Dropdown > Reconsider component naming,"## Purpose

Discuss renaming the current **listbox** component while simplifying the dropdown variants.

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/2832 the dropdown component naming was discussed, specifically in regards to the listbox. A `listbox` itself can be part of a disclosure or a `combobox`, but at the moment we're identifying it as its own component that includes the trigger button to reveal it.

It's possible we could reduce the number of documented dropdown variants by treating the listbox as a base component used in composite components.

For example:

- **Disclosure widget**:
  - Button that opens panel of links or a mix of links and actions (buttons).
  - Button that opens a `listbox` containing options (`role=""option""`).
- **Combobox**:
  - Text input that opens a `listbox` containing options (`role=""option""`).
- **Menu**:
  - Button that opens a panel of JavaScript app-like actions.

### Comments from the original MR

>This definition makes me wonder whether `GlListbox` is correctly named, since it implements the button *and* listbox … Maybe whether or not this matters depends on whether we'd ever want to implement a ""bare"" listbox that's always visible and not just in a popup.

>We could name it`GlCollapsibleListbox` as it is named in [the specs example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/listbox/listbox-collapsible.html).",2

In addition we should update the component to also allow other states as focus & disabled in instances.

Daniel then warned me about Taurie's comment on another issue that could be related: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78012#note_923457878

## Proposal

Let's add some guidance to the empty state guidelines, establish that it's ok to hide the UI in some occasions but that it needs to be carefully thought through as there are cases when showing the UI, even if there's seemingly nothing to show still makes sense and offers more value to the user and hence produces a better user experience.",2

<!-- Add a short description of the documentation addition or update. Remember to say why, not just what. -->

Currently we use inconsistent widths for the dropdown inputs and the dropdown panels. The problems I see:

- Often times the panel width doesn't match the dropdown button or input width
- The dropdown buttons and inputs are sometimes too long for the content

| The dropdown could match the input in width. | The dropdown could match the dropdown button in width. |

## Proposal

I wonder if having set input field widths like `sm` `md` `lg` and `xl` would cover most cases in the product. If we already have fixed sizes for the dropdown button, input, and the dropdown panels, can we make the sizes match so the panel width can be same as the input in most cases?

The width of the dropdown button or input will be selected based on the average expected input string length, and the dropdown width should match the button/input width, except when the input is shorter than the dropdown panel min width. 

It'd make the input much more consistent visually.

107241908,2022-04-26 19:34:21.883,VPAT > Introduce VPAT 2.4 WCAG template,"## Purpose

GitLab currently uses the [VPAT 2.4 508 template](https://www.itic.org/dotAsset/7d1524dc-e602-47be-8276-ce32bdd58d6c.doc) that uses WCAG 2.0 Level AA Success Criteria as a reference. This doesn't satisfy the needs of those wanting to know where GitLab stands with WCAG 2.1, which is the latest release (WCAG 2.2 is still in draft). For that, there's a separate [VPAT 2.4 WCAG](https://www.itic.org/dotAsset/7edcd54d-c6a6-4649-8375-4a0f0c68eff2.doc) template that we can introduce. For a list of all VPAT templates, visit https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat.

### Process

- Update navigation in Pajamas to create a ""GitLab Accessibility Conformance Report"" dropdown that reveals two options:
  - VPAT 2.4 508
  - VPAT 2.4 WCAG
- Update the current ""GitLab Accessibility Conformance Report"" page title to ""VPAT 2.4 508""
- Add a new ""VPAT 2.4 WCAG"" page
  - Copy the WCAG 2.0 2.0 data from the VPAT 2.4 508 page into this page
  - Complete an evaluation that adds conformance findings for the [success criteria added in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/)
- Clarify VPAT and WCAG level on the [Statement of Compliance](https://design.gitlab.com/accessibility/a11y) page",3

   - For changes or additions to an existing file, create a branch in Figma (this new file is considered the “working file”). Include the issue or MR number in the branch name. Make changes in the working file and request a review when ready. See https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/ for details about branching.
   - For new files, duplicate the template that is most relevant (https://www.figma.com/files/project/5846042/Templates) to the project that also is the most relevant. Update the file name and cover details (this new file is considered the “working file”) and proceed with the design.
   - For community contributions, create a new file in your drafts, or duplicate an existing file to your drafts.

-->

### Description

In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1283, the proposal is to move the character counter outside of the textarea bounds. Given that a similar character counter exists as an add-on in the text input, this issue is to help determine if the character counter should be moved outside of the input bounds and treated as help text (which it is), or to remove it altogether if it's unused.

**Note**: The character counter add-on doesn't currently exist in GitLab UI.

### Proposal

Two options:

1. Remove the character counter from the text input altogether if there are no use cases to support it.
   - Benefits:
     - No need to have a build effort in GitLab UI.
     - Removing unneeded/unused options.
1. Move the character-counter outside of the input bounds and treat as help text.
   - Benefits:
     - More room for content within the input bounds.
     - Better UX by providing more helpful feedback than just a single number.
     - More consistency with textarea proposal and use of help text.
     - Simplification of component both in the UI kit, and in code.
     - More accessible by providing meaningful feedback outside of the input bounds.

| Option A | Option B* |
| ------ | ------ |
| ![CleanShot_2022-04-04_at_08.59.57_2x](/uploads/e7247028197e4afb335ea9c39c165a2f/CleanShot_2022-04-04_at_08.59.57_2x.png) | ![image](/uploads/f1ca563e3cab0169b40ae5a2de5f839c/image.png) |

\* Option B could either use a {#/#} pattern or more natural text. Also explored in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1283#proposal.

**Questions**

- Is there anywhere in the product that currently uses a character counter on a text input?
- Is there a current use case for the character counter that some form of help text wouldn't satisfy?

-->

### Description

Reconsider the placement of the character counter text and reconsider how the information can be more clearly conveyed. The current counter shows one number, but doesn't provide any comparison.

As uncovered in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/2738#note_896569524, the current placement of the counter collides with both text within the textarea and the scrollbar.

### Proposal

- Move the character counter outside of the textarea bounding box.
- Left align the character counter. This follows other form practices where labels and controls are left aligned and help with scanability.
- Use either a text explanation of what's happening with the counter, or two values so that the limit is always visible.
- The character counter is basically help text, so it seems to make sense to treat it as such. Additional help text and any validation messages would be below the character counter.
- Remove text highlight (adds a lot of development complexity).
- Only change the color for text when the count has been exceeded. The blue conflicts with text that is linked.

#### Accessibility considerations

- Visible feedback should also be available/announced for screen reader users. For example, after a pause in typing the limit status is announced via an `aria-live=""polite""` region.
- The placement of the counter could be out of view with screen magnification turned on, but form validation should help with any error remediation.

Following on from the changes in #1280+

Badges with 16px icons retain their icon overrides when changing variation.

Badges with 12px icons do not retain their icon overrides when changing variation.

# Proposal

Make 12px and 16px icon Figma variants behave the same way.

As discussed in the Figma branch for #1280 there are some tradeoffs to be aware of:

- Lose a 'sensible' default

### [Figma branch for review :eyes:](https://www.figma.com/file/xIqrqxGgcl50I8akiQzfmG/%231281-badge-12px-and-16px-icon-override-parity?node-id=19947%3A350)

<details><summary>Full conversation:</summary>

Hey Jeremy Elder Nadia Sotnikova 

here's a little bug fix for the 12px icon variants to fix
- Colour persistence when changing icon
- Icon persistence when changing variant

This makes the 12px icon behaviour the same as the 16px icon behaviour.

However, it does come with some tradeoffs
- Lose the 'sensible default' icon for each status

wdyt?

Changes:
- base components: Rename icon symbol layers
- base components: Relink icons to icon library
- variant components: Update to use naming from base component
- variant components: use the same icon to allow icon change persistence

---

Dan MH ""Lose the 'sensible default' icon for each status"" might be a dealbreaker for me. These have specific icon/color relationships that should exist out of the box.

---

Jeremy Elder I respect and understand that.

I found this unexpected behaviour when trying to add a badge to the Single Stat - https://www.figma.com/file/17NxNEMa7i28Is8sMetO2H/Data-Visualization?node-id=383%3A72

It is a pretty high friction process in its current form. And the defaults aren't sensible here.
To clarify — my expectation was for these to follow the same persistence rules as 16px icons.

The good news is, I'm 90% sure there is an alternative way we can set these up:
- Icon swaps use the right colour
- Variant (colour) swaps change the icon to the icon defined in the variant. 

---

Dan MH would you be good with me updating this branch to the latest? It'll include the new tier badge.

---

Jeremy Elder I'd prefer to do it so I can remember what the changes were see_no_evil emoji

But only if we think we will proceed with any of these updates?

Otherwise we can just delete the branch

---

>But only if we think we will proceed with any of these updates?

I think it's a valid proposal if you're 90% sure it can be done!
Applied changes from main, so it may have reset the icons here.

---

To confirm the desired/proposed behaviour:

- 12px icon badges come bundled with an icon
- Icon changes maintain the correct colour to match the badge pill
- Changing the colour variant changes the icon to the bundled icon

If I'm tying myself in knots trying to explain I can jump on a quick sync at some point

Ok thats all done, and I think it is an improvement as is. :) 

However, for many of my use cases the 'sensible defaults' hinder rather than help — so it would be nice to consider changing this behaviour to match the 16px icons in the future!

---

Dan MH after some consideration, I don't know that it's helpful to be as prescriptive here.

I had to circle back and through about the ability for you to extend these for your use case, but then that indeed would mean overriding this use case, but this use case is prescriptive and not universal, which isn't what we're going for here. Follow?

So… I'm up for reworking these to use generic defaults that can be updated at the time of use.

What could be helpful, would be adding out instances of the different color/icon/size associations commonly found. Thoughts?

---

Thanks for the continued discussion here Jeremy Elder .

Honestly I do see both sides of it.

My workaround was going to be to create extension of these (and other) symbols that match Optimizes use case and maintain them in an Optimize library.

I don't know what is best for the system and its users. Happy to follow your lead here.

I do think merging as-is would be an improvement, perhaps we could open this conversation wider for the last bit?

---

Dan MH Figma is having a tough go at spelling out what the changes are that I'm approving, could you unpack it a little further in the review description when you have a moment?

---

Jeremy Elder I've documented it in this issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/issues/1280

I wasn't expecting this much discussion, otherwise I would have created it sooner :D
