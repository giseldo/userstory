Torvus the bridge between discord and ingame server changes the alias to represent the writer on discord.
Due to recent addition of announcing the change this gets very confusing to use the bridge.

- Change the toolchain in the main repo and the Docker image repo

<details>
    <summary>MisterTeapot's response</summary>
    <pre>
Thanks @AᎬᏒᎾᏁᎥᏟ [UTC-5], we're super excited!  Ok, so here's a few super quick notes regarding our potential audio system. Obviously there's a ton of room for expansion and clarification here, but this is probably a decent starting point for discussion. Implementation wise, I think our audio would loosely fall into four groups:

Music
Environment SFX
Event SFX
Menu/GUI SFX

Music

-Typically streamed
-Needs to have some sort of tagging system for jukebox, ie, ""exploring"", ""battle"", ""town"", ""dungeon""
-Needs to be able to cross-fade or at least fade out/fade in when changing areas
-Given how much content is already finished in this area, dynamic/procedural music is likely out of scope


Environment SFX

-Loaded into memory on area load
-Ambient loops for each major area type, ie, gentle breeze with leaves rustling in forest, stonger wind in mountains
-Support for positional audio such as flowing water, bird chirps

Event SFX

-Loaded with corresponding entity instantiation
-Footsteps, glide loop, combat sounds, item interaction sounds (ie opening doors/chests), etc
-Will need some very basic DSP, ie random ranged pitch for footsteps, pitch/EQ for glide loop


Menu/GUI SFX

-Tied to input triggers, (click/confirm, scroll, mouse over etc. need trigger list from UI team)
-Usually these get loaded once, and then called from pool
-Depending on how 'Juicy' we go with UI design, may require animation tagging (although we can probably fake it)
-Dialog system probably fits in here as well, assuming that we're doing dialog boxes and not full voice-over
-Dialog could be as simple as clicks/keystrokes as the words scroll, or more complex sythesis ala Animal Crossing
    </pre>
</details>

This issue is for further discussion on the overarching audio system design.

From reading his response and what I've gathered from reading on the topic, I've made a list of features that need to be implemented. As we decide we are ready to add the feature, we can make an issue, link to it, and once it is finished we can check it off.

* [x] An audio description file (probably in the .ron format) (SFX: !563)
* [ ] A way to mark audio as streaming vs. loaded into memory
* [ ] Audio banks that can be loaded and unloaded
* [x] Fade in, fade out, crossfade
* [ ] Pitch shifting
* [ ] Possibly a dynamic/procedural music engine
* [x] A way to tag music based on the context it should be played in
* [x] Positional audio

I am ignoring the audio that should be added to the game in this issue and focusing solely on the programming.",10
24513683,2019-09-05 22:34:39.157,Add worker for `Chunk` optimisation,"_I write this issue as if !475 has already been merged._

A worker, running in the thread pool, should be implemented that _optimises_ the loaded `Chunk`s.
Such an optimisation is comprised of:

1. Finding out which is the best voxel to serve as `self.default`.
   Usually this would be one of the following three voxels:
   * `self.below` of the containing `Chonk`.
   * Water.
   * `self.above` of the containing `Chonk`.
2. Order the groups (see !475 for the concept of a “group”) by morton order.
   This might improve cache friendliness.
   Having the groups sorted by morton order has no overhead because groups are accessed through a lookup table anyways. (`self.indices` is that lookup table.)",5

To build a complete system, we would need to expand this to properly handle situations such as dual wielding, 2h weapons, mixed dual wields (sword+shield) and freedom to use left or right hands to hold weapons. This breaks down into several steps:

- set up ""left weapon"" and ""right weapon"" as bones in the skeleton, as opposed to just weapon
- set up these bones in the animation code as corresponding to left and right hands, respectively, allowing for them to sync with hands. currently we sync both hands to ""weapon"" and this won't handle 1h weapons well.
- set up choice to place 2h weapons in either left or right hands, with the non-chosen side corresponding to: a) a secondary hand movement that is also synced to that weapon, and b) an empty weapon slot, and no weapon asset. we'll need matches set up so that equipping a 2h sword in the left slot will trigger a ""2h sword secondary"" flag in the right slot, so that the right slot can instruct the opposite hand about how to move.",5

20408236,2019-04-27 22:03:32.954,Gitlab CI runner paradigm,"So there is a rather large issue with how Gilab CI fundamentally works. Since MRs originate from the contributor's repo, Gitlab CI is run from their repo as well. This means that unless it is specially configured on their end, they will be making use of shared runners for the entirety of the MR, and only when they merge to master will their code be verified by the main repo's CI.

This has always been an issue I think. As you can see [here](https://gitlab.com/zesterer/fresh/-/jobs/200371247), at the top it is using `docker-auto-scale ed2dce3a`, which is a shared runner, not our runner. This means much longer build times, as it has to compile without the cache our runners have.

Gitlab has known about this problem with their paradigm for a bit, but they haven't come up with a good solution yet. You can see the current status here,
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21991

Currently, I see a few options.

1. Give instructions to all contributors on how to disable shared runners, and enable ours. This solution is mediocre, as it has a few downsides,
- Getting users to go through the process could be a hassle on the debugging side if something goes wrong
- This is assuming that each contributor has an up to date version of `gitlab-ci.yaml`. If they don't, then they won't be running the same CI as the main repo, which could lead to issues after merging.

2. Get contributors to make branches and work on master. Again, a mediocre solution, but I think it has more positives than negatives.

|       Pros;
- CI on MRs will always be the same
- People can see what branches and code is being worked on

|       Cons;
- Lots of branches could clutter up the repo
- Need to give developer access to everyone who wants to work on Veloren

The login server should be separate from the game server. This will enable a central authentication server. A central authentication server will let people use one username in all game servers that subscribe to it. 

To store passwords, we should use the `ring` crate's pbkf2 implementation to hash the passwords. [More info here.](https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/pbkdf2/index.html)

20079740,2019-04-15 17:31:05.673,Users timeout when connecting to the server using a debug build,"Cargo defaults to building Debug builds. Some individuals compiling and connecting for the first time will run into a client / server timeout while transitioning from the Login to the Character Selection screen.

The bug is that the UI images for character selection are loaded on the main event loop. This halts client/server polling so the server times out and disconnects the client.

Order of events:
*  voxygen/src/menu/main/mod.rs: `MainMenuState::play` is handling UI events. As the player clicks Login, `CharSelectionState::new` is called to initialize the character selection UI. This is called within the UI event handling.
*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/mod.rs: `CharSelectionState::new` calls `CharSelectionUi::new`.
*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/ui.rs: `CharSelectionUi::new` calls `Imgs::new`.
*  voxygen/src/menu/char_selection/ui.rs: `Imgs::new` loads 61 images. This takes some time, holding up the UI event loop and preventing the client from sending keep-alives.

Possible solution:
*  `CharSelectionState::play` handles this new window's event loop. Add code to the beginning to spawn the `CharSelectionUi::new` logic in a new thread (recommend rename of this method from new to load_async?). While CharSelectionUi is loading, alternate between polling it state for completion and handling the client. Once loading is complete, continue into the current event loop.",2
