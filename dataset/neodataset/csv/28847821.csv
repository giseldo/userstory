114314851,2022-09-01 20:40:46.377,ENG: Full Hero Carousel,"## Goal
We would like to test adding a full hero carousel to the homepage which will improve engagement as measured by CTA clicks within the homepage hero.

This issue is to create the functionality for the home carousel not to implement it live.  We also want this to be a new component and not overwrite the current home hero.  We should use the current home hero as a starting point in this carousel.

- [ ] The carousel transition includes left text and image
- [ ] The user should be able to click to move to the next slide
- [ ] The carousel should be flexible that can handle 2-5 slides
- [ ] When a user mouses over the entire carousel the timer should pause
- [x] Work with @dennischarukulvanich so we can track the CTAs per slide

When engineering is done we should make sure the old hero is on the home page and we can merge this new component to wait for content.

This issue is to track a Proof of Concept for the Smartling Code Repo prior to contracting it this year.

* Note the DRI of the POC will be the Product or Eng Teams (this issue can be moved if necessary)
* Digital Experience team will be DRI related to the website as the Code Repo Connector is an alternative to the GDN (this issue can be copied if necessary)

### Proof of Concept Options

1. TBD

### Comments from Smartling

* Prior to any POC, Smartling requested that we define what a successful POC looks like.
* Our next steps on the website evaluation will be to arrange a technical demo of the Code Repo Connector highlighting any specific use cases or actions the team would like to validate.
* We can schedule a discussion of the pros and cons to use our Repository Connector Vs the GDN to support the website translation initiative both are great options, the deciding factors will be based on your overall strategy/objectives of the website translations project and the team's desired experience/LOE.

### Next Steps

* Determine what we would like to get out of the POC? What questions are we trying to answer / what does success look like?
* Determine POC options for the Code Repo Connector.
* Technical discussion with Smartling related to using the GDN or the Code Repo for website translation.

The reason for the cost is that we would be able to continue to use the GDN once it is set-up and we add it to the contract.
1) Partial Deployment - We would select a few pages (number TBD) and Smartling would connect these to show us how it works. If it is only a few pages, there wouldn't be a cost to this.
1) In depth technical demo - This would be a 90 minute call with Smartling where they would show us (on their site), a step-by-step demo of how the GDN works. This would not be on our site.

### Comments from Smartling
- Prior to any POC, Smartling requested that we define what a successful POC looks like.
- Our next steps on the website evaluation will be to arrange a technical demo of the GDN on the GitLab website highlighting any specific use cases or actions the team would like to validate.
- Similarly, we can schedule a discussion of the pros and cons to use our Repository Connector Vs the GDN to support the website translation initiative both are great options, the deciding factors will be based on your overall strategy/objectives of the website translations project and the team's desired experience/LOE.

### Next Steps
- Determine what we would like to get out of the POC? What questions are we trying to answer / what does success look like?
- Determine which POC option we are most interested in based on the POC goals.
- Technical discussion with Smartling related to using the GDN or the Code Repo for website translation.


### Requests from Smartling
Smartling asked that we answer these questions prior to our GDN discussion.

1- What is the business objective surrounding translations? (Ex: Drive more leads to the website, convert more leads on the website, support an existing international sales team to convert more deals, etc)
 * Answer: Drive more leads, support an existing sales team to convert more deals

2- What success metric will you be tracking against as it relates to translation (Website metrics (traffic, conversion rates, page views, bounce rate, etc), sales team conversation success, new user adoption, decrease in support tickets, etc)
 * Answer: Website metrics, new INQ, trials
 
3- Please list in the order of priority the content you are looking to translate. (Specific websites, Landing Pages, Blogs, Web application)
 * Answer: Ultimately, we will translate about.gitlab.com and all navigation pages. To start with the POC, we will translate the [Homepage](about.gitlab.com), [Why Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/why-gitlab/), [Pricing Page] (https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)

4- What Technology do you use to create and/or serve this content? (CMS, Marketing Automation, E-Comm Platform, Other?)
 * **Need answer**

5.1- What source language is your content in?
 * Answer: English

5.2- Which language(s) are you translating into?
 * Answer: Japanese, French, German

6- What are your annual translation volumes? (best guess of plan is fine)
 * Answer: Currently around 160k processed words for marketing, but this is expected to increase. Web hasn't been started yet.

7- Stakeholders
a. Who needs to be involved in the evaluation?  Answer: Digital Experience team, Marketing Ops, others TBD
b. Who will be using the tool?  Answer: Digital Experience team (technical GDN), project management DRI TBD
c. Who will be vetting the technology and integration path? Answer: Digital Experience team
d. Who is the budget holder for sign-off? Answer: Marketing Operations

8- Describe your ideal translation process.
 * **Answer: Need answer**

9- Describe the challenges you are facing in the current process.
 * Answer: No solution for web translations currently in place.

10- What do you need to see in our solution to move forward with Smartling? 
 * **Answer: Need answer, what does success look like**

113367461,2022-08-16 22:00:51.278,Google Analytics Tracking: SaaS Trial Event,"## Goal

Review the new SaaS Trial flow here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K-fwk3n_mqN_JDfGGXWMETfIWLPhRoWsEdmV7yJDD-M/

Add the Google Tag Manager JS and OneTrust (if not already included) to the new ""About Your Company"" page: 
**gitlab.com/users/sign_up/company/new**

Paste this code as high in the `<head>` of the page as possible:
```
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-NJXWQL');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
```

Additionally, paste this code immediately after the opening `<body>` tag:
```
<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript><iframe src=""https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-NJXWQL""
height=""0"" width=""0"" style=""display:none;visibility:hidden""></iframe></noscript>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
```


Fire the following dataLayer event upon a successful form submission after the ""Continue"" button click. The `aboutYourCompanyType` should be dynamic. If the user is part of the Free Account flow, they will have an additional toggle field ""Gitlab Ultimate Trial"". If the user is part of the SaaS flow, the field should not be there, so the variable value should be `ultimate_trial`. 
```
dataLayer.push({
  'event':'aboutYourCompanyFormSubmit',
  'aboutYourCompanyType':'[ultimate_trial or free_account]'

113361153,2022-08-16 18:31:28.652,ENG: Implement Launchdarkly with Custom Events,"## Goal

According to this [support ticket](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/uploads/852679b3678d1a281b31d99956848d78/Hello__We_are_using_Launchd...___LaunchDarkly.pdf), we need to make sure our metrics are set up as custom events within LaunchDarkly. 

> If you are changing the URL upon click, you would have to use a custom conversion (Such as if
you were submitting a form that redirects to a new page, etc.).

> If your click metric triggers a page redirect, then the redirect is happening before the click
event can be sent back to LaunchDarkly.

> Click metrics are unfortunately not very robust; I would suggest recreating the metric as a
custom conversion metric instead:
https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/experimentation/metrics/custom-conversion.

> This way, you have greater control and can call track when you need to and flush immediately
right after to ensure that the metric event is captured prior to redirect.

Hypothesis: The behavior that I have when using click events is that clicking on said targets will result in incrementing the unique visitors by 1.

Discovered in this MR: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/897

`.hidden` class doesn't update when passing URL parameters to pages with a LaunchDarkly component. Checking the props within the LaunchDarkly components shows us the value of the `loading` data value is correct. This makes me believe that the component is not showing this change in value within the UI.

113302494,2022-08-15 18:06:52.541,Docs Subdomain - Update Google Tag Manager ID,"## Goal
The current Google Tag Manager account ID on the docs subdomain is set to `GTM-WZCXKT5` - no one can access this GTM account because it was created by a former employee on their personal work email address. There is an issue within the Google Analytics page URL data where `/index.html` needs to be included in order to match the correlated `index.md` file (analyzed by the technical content writers). Related GitLab [issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1214#note_1064405619). 

In order to affix `/index.html`, we'll need to first update the Google Tag Manager ID from `GTM-WZCXKT5` to `GTM-NJXWQL` on docs.gitlab.com, that way we can configure a new GA tags on a GTM account we have access to. 

### Instructions

- Revise the existing GTM code in the `<head>` by switching the ID from `GTM-WZCXKT5` to `GTM-NJXWQL` (<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/content/assets/javascripts/google_tagmanager.js>):

  ```js
  (function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
  new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],

  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
  })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-NJXWQL');
  ```

- Additionally, update the ID in GTM `<body>` tag (<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/layouts/gtm.html>):

  ```html
  <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
  <noscript><iframe src=""https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-NJXWQL""

We would like to enable feature flags for the Buyer Experience repository.

### Jobs To Be Done
Feature flags deploy your application’s new features to production in smaller batches. You can toggle a feature on and off to subsets of users, helping you achieve Continuous Delivery. Feature flags help reduce risk, allowing you to do controlled testing, and separate feature delivery from customer launch.

We would like to add the minimized footer to the Nav repository so we can use it within Buyer Experience

As part of the refresh a few months ago, we created a minimized footer with a goal for it to be used on the Pricing page. Looks like it is not being used there anymore, but the mini-footer still lives in BE. It would be nice to use for our Commit page, but the Web IDE and View Source buttons are not dynamic to the page/do not work. Also, @justin.vetter proposed a good point in that the mini-footer does not contain any legal type of links, such as our Privacy policy.

111661310,2022-07-14 19:36:28.584,[SPIKE] Understanding features.yml,"# Investigate features.yml
### Introduction
The www-gitlab-com repository has 1 massive data file, features.yml, and 2 smaller related files, categories.yml and stages.yml:
- features.yml is over 11,000 lines long with 554 features.
- categories.yml is over 2500 lines long with 132 categories.
- stages.yml is over 2300 lines long.


### Why is it an issue?
Last year (2021) the decision was made to start migrating the marketing site from the www-gitlab-com repository into a new repository (buyer experience). This year, there are efforts being made to migrate the handbook out of the www-gitlab-com repository and into it's own. Since the features.yml file feeds content to both the handbook and buyer experience pages, we need to come up with an automated solution. While coming up with the solution we should also rethink the data structure, and how we can best serve the people using it (product). How can we make the product teams life easier while satisfying the needs of handbook and buyer experience.

Lets write a script that removes unused assets from the repository. This will have compounding beneficial effects - every pipeline is faster, cloning the repository is faster, and the size the repository becomes smaller.

The first iteration of this script [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/101054). Unfortunately, that script takes too long to run through the `www-gitlab-com` repository. For the next iteration of this script, we'll create an array of image filenames and search the repository once. This should reduce the amount of time it takes for the script to complete.

> is there a way to dynamically set all links to go to pages within this experience? Currently they link out to the live site.

Michael is referring to the review app at [https://refresh.about.gitlab-review.app/](https://refresh.about.gitlab-review.app/). But more generally, this issue will happen to *any* review app, if we use absolute URLs.

Our lives will be a lot easier for local development, review app feedback, and production deployments if we use relative paths across this website. 

As an example, an absolute path is: `https://about.gitlab.com/enterprise/`. Whereas the relative path would be `/enterprise/`. 

The advantage of using the relative path is that it keeps users on the same root domain as they navigate a particular deployment. It also ensure that we don't accidentally click links and go to different environments in development. 

This is the same approach we should take for images (until we get a digital asset management tool, which will change the strategy). Images should refer to relative file paths, and should exist in our repository. 

I think the fix for this is for someone to go through and:

1. Search the entire Buyer Experience repository for references to `https://about.gitlab.com`
1. Convert the reference to be a relative link (where applicable - there may be some edge cases that really should always point to production, but I can't think of any off the top of my head)
1. We should consider a linter that will check for this, although truthfully I think that's a hard problem to solve, because sometimes we really truly need to write an absolute path (again, I can't think of when, but we might), and I don't love having linters check every single text file for these kinds of strings. It will slow down our CI. Personally, I would prefer to catch this in code review where we can. But if someone has a better, automated proposal, I'm all ears.",2

104795980,2022-03-14 18:49:20.415,Spike a better solution for handling data in Nuxt pages,"## Goal

We'd like to manage the content in the Nuxt site in a more consistent, extensible, flexible way. 

The pages this matters most for are in the upcoming work. `@mpreuss22` gave us the [rundown of our current commitment in Slack]():

Goal is to deliver 10 amazing, newly designed pages with the rest of the site being on brand, live by April 27th:

Tier 01 (Doing 2nd): 3-4 page templates - Complete new vision, design, and content
* Homepage
* Pricing Page
* Solutions / Features Pages
* Install (stretch)

Tier 02 (Doing 3rd): 6-7 page templates - Well considered new design, significant new content, limited new branded/image/motion assets

* Category Leadership (Currently called Topics)
* Demo
* Enterprise
* SMB
* DevOps Lifecycle Pages
* Getting Started
* Contact Sales

Tier 03 (Doing 1st): - New coat of paint: updated fonts, colours, logos
Everything else: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ualGLPCyFjEpiskrfAe2ftqoTAw8t56lO1LMzMT7Ojo/edit

So to start, I'm going to look at the Tier 01 pages and do the following: 

1. See which, if any, we have represented in `content`
1. Take a look at how their page level `.vue` files consume that data
1. Identify common data structures, identify oddities and outliers (stuff that needs special handling)
1. Write up a spec for how we should structure data to be consumed by pages
1. Pitch that spec to @ndubord as a first iteration 

Once I do that, I'll write up an interface and try it out on the Homepage. I'll put together more specific issues for each page as I go. 

I'm going to timebox this to about a day-and-a-half, and see how far I can get on it. Once I know more, I'll add additional points, add additional issues, etc.",3

104785363,2022-02-24 15:10:55.188,Create GA View to track Customer Portal and other purchasing flows,"<!-- Please submit issue with the following format: As a _____ (role in marketing), I would like to ____________(need), so that ________________(reason).-->
<!-- Example: As GTM management, I would like to know that all Trials are MQLing, so that MQL metrics are accurate and we can rely on them for decision making.-->

## As a team focused on customer self-service transactions, I would like a dedicated GA View to provide fast reporting on trial and checkout flows without having to set up custom reports or drill down many levels.

# What we need to know:

## The problem

The Self-Service team would like to track sessions, pageviews, and events (clicks) on the areas of our marketing site and customer portal that our customers use to subscribe and grow. These areas of the site get relatively less traffic compared to marketing and handbook pages, and so are more challenging to report on using the default GA view.

## What specific questions do we need to answer?

- General default GA reporting (Audience, Acquisition, Content, Events) but specific to these parts of the site/customer portal

## What are your must-have's?

These subdomains and pages:

Subdomain:

* customers.gitlab.com

Pages within gitlab.com (regex match):

* /-/subscriptions
* /-/profile/usage_quotas
* /-/usage_quotas
* /trials/
* /pricing/
* /sign_up
* /trial_registrations/

## Do you have any specific metrics, categories or charts in mind?

No, standard GA

## Context

- Audience: Internal GitLab team members, especially Self-Service, Product Intelligence
- When will this likely deliver business value? Immediately
- Due date: ASAP
- Format: GA View

## In scope

Add the `saasTrialProjectImport` events to those buttons. But as we did in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/361, we should change this event to `projectImport`, since the form is shown to regular user sign ups as well as trial sign ups. 

We can use the `trial_onboarding_flow=true` parameter in the URL to filter against true/false. 

I will preserve the other data points and track `'projectImport': '[PLATFORM]'` as we were before for which platform people click.

118093866,2022-11-03 16:10:36.225,Why Pricing Pages - Safari - Mobile Breakpoint + Sidebar,"## Goal
We would like to ensure the sidebar navigation behaves correctly on smaller Safari viewports. Users need to be able to read the main content.

### Describe the Bug
In safari, when you make the viewport narrower than 1024px the nav switches to the mobile version. On the Why Ultimate and Why Premium pricing pages, there's a sidebar navigation that floats out from the right side and begins to overlap the content. As the screen gets smaller, the conent becomes unreadable because the sidebar nav is laying ontop. 

![Screen_Shot_2022-11-03_at_9.09.04_AM](/uploads/f071a6d5fa257667f06405114a3e3740/Screen_Shot_2022-11-03_at_9.09.04_AM.png)

I discovered this while QA testing the [2.0 navigation MR for BE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/1271). These pages are now linked to directly from the footer. 

But since this is a current bug in production, it's not blocking to the release of the 2.0 nav.

This is probably the case on other pages using that sidebar component.

118014782,2022-11-02 14:43:15.048,ENG: Replace all instances of all-caps with title-case,"## Goal
Our `all-caps` type is off brand and we should replace it with `title-case`. Instances using the `SlpTypography` `all-caps` variant have been identified, but we should do further research as part of this issue as to where `text-transform: uppercase` might be being used as an alternative and change those if applicable.

Related: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1554

Additional context: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/slippers-ui/-/issues/236#note_1156356616


**What is the ultimate end goal vision vs the MVC1 iteration?**
 - The end goal for this iteration is that there are no instance of `all-caps` or similar `uppercase` style type across Buyer Experience - they should be replaced with a different type style.


## File(s)
The following files have instances of `all-caps` but this does NOT include instances of `text-transform: uppercase`.

117743096,2022-10-28 10:46:01.183,Major Duplication on FR subfolder,"## Goal
We would like to address a major duplication error on our website which might have a negative effect on SEO if not addressed urgently.

#### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *Major duplication caused by a technical error*
* **Motivation**: *Remove all duplicates*
* **Outcome**: *So we can prevent Google from penalizing our website and protect our organic traffic*

#### Please provide more information related to this request
Make sure the information you provide is relevant for your request. If unsure, please provide all the fields. Add/remove rows as needed.

Our SEO monitoring tool has detected an increase in page title changes, meta description changes and newly created pages in the /fr-fr/ folder. On closer inspection it seems like a majority of about.gitlab.com pages are duplicated in the `/fr-fr/` folder. 

**For example:**
- Direction - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/direction/ops/
- Security - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/security/cap/
- Solutions - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/solutions/kubernetes/
- Blog - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/blog/2016/09/26/infrastructure-update/
- Topics - https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/topics/gitops/ 

At the time of creating this issue, over [1700 duplicate pages are now indexed in Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aabout.gitlab.com%2Ffr-fr%2F&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB900GB900&biw=1280&bih=919&sxsrf=ALiCzsYafVY9WQdboMx1Vxx02vAmwHZVBQ%3A1666953051190&ei=W69bY8WgC4eWhbIPp8OWsAE&ved=0ahUKEwiFuuSD3IL7AhUHS0EAHaehBRYQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=site%3Aabout.gitlab.com%2Ffr-fr%2F&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQA0oECEEYAUoECEYYAFCqB1iqB2C9CGgBcAB4AIABRIgBRJIBATGYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) which is a major concern.

### Duplicate Content SEO Implications

Duplicate content is when you have URLs that have identical HTML content to at least one other indexable URL. If this sort of duplication occurs, you have a relatively serious issue, whereby URLs with identical content are accessible to search engine crawlers. If this results in large scale duplicate content issues on the site, you could trip quality algorithms like Google's Panda, which can depress organic search traffic to the site as a whole.


**If this is urgent, what is the business need for the urgency?**
- [ ]  Yes: `Prevent Google from penalizing our website`

If the requestor is not the DRI, find out if the DRI is aware of the request / wants to change things.

**What is the ultimate end goal vision vs the MVC1 iteration?**
 - End goal for this MVC iteration is to removal all duplicate pages

**How do we measure success?**
 - Reduction in duplicate pages indexed in Google.

```
dataLayer.push({

102213972,2022-02-10 14:52:35.160,IA Refresh - Redirect Mapping,"To minimize the impact of structural change in the IA refresh we need to set up 301 redirects for deprecated and consolidated pages. We need to match your old URLs with the new ones or relevant alternatives. Without proper redirection, our new/consolidated pages will not get the traffic and PageRank of the old pages, which will affect our search engine rankings.

## Redirecting best practices
- To best preserve search rankings and traffic for better performing pages, it is best to keep the URL structure intact.
- When removing, deprecating or consolidating URLs it is important to redirect to a relevant alternative to preserve the SEO value from backlinks 
- Update internal links from the old URLs to the new URLs to prevent internal redirects which impacts crawl budget. 
- Check for existing 301 redirects to URLs that will be removed, relocated or consolidated. Updating these to the new URLs will prevent redirect chains and loops which impacts crawl budget.

## Risks
Combining, changing URLs or deprecating pages comes with risks that will affect SEO efforts. If not properly managed we run the risk of:
- Losing SEO value from backlinks attributed to removed or relocated URLs
- Drop in search traffic and rankings. It might take some time for search engines to update their search index.
- Increase in 404 errors, redirect chains and redirect loops.
- Increase in soft 404s error messages in Google Search Console.

### Outcomes
Based on the results of the content audit we have four suggested outcomes.

**Leave as is**

No need to delete or redirect. The page has good traffic and a healthy backlink profile. Removing these pages will have a negative impact on traffic. 
If deleted we must redirect to an alternative page and 301 redirect to ensure the link equity is maintained. 

**Redirect or Update**

The page gets no meaningful traffic but has at least 1 backlink. This needs to be manually reviewed by code owners/departments to ensure nothing of strategic value is removed.

Options:
- Improve SEO by updating the content
- Merge content with similar page and redirect to new location
- Delete page and redirect to alternative

**Manual review**

Pages with OK traffic and little from organic search. This needs to be manually reviewed by code owners/departments to ensure nothing of strategic value is removed.

Options:
- Leave as is
- Improve SEO by updating the content
- Merge content with similar page 
- Delete page and redirect to alternative

**Delete Page**

These pages has no meaningful traffic from any source and no backlinks. This needs to be manually reviewed by code owners/departments to ensure nothing of strategic value is removed.

Options:
- Delete page and redirect to alternative",10

101678009,2022-02-01 16:57:26.119,Topics Template Layout Changes,"We've have looking at the recently migrated CI/CD topics page and we have identified a few changes and issues (listed below) that may have a negative impact on our current and future SEO efforts.

### Topic Navigation Links
All the ""More on this topic"" links are external and in most cases the link is irrelevant to the topic. Before the switch these were all internal. This can be amended but we need to ensure we preserve all internal links when migrating.

### Heading Heirachy
Headings gives search engines important clues about the page structure and relevancy. headings should be logically structured, starting with a h1 followed by h2's, and subsequent h3's fir related subsections, etc. The current structure isn't in a logical order. Search engines utilse header structures to decipher the informational structure and topical hierarchy of a page.

For example:

- `<h2 class=""copy__title"" data-v-b44de53e="""" data-v-34d03aa1="""">Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)</h2> `. This should be **H1**.

- `<h3 class=""header slp-text-xxl"" data-v-b44de53e="""" data-v-daaa09f2=""""> What is CI/CD? </h3> `. This should be **H2**.

### FAQ schema
The FAQ schema.org markup is missing from the page. This was implemented to make search engine better understand page contents and display the pages in the form of Rich Snippets in SERPs.

### Self referencing canonical path
Self referencing canonical path is missing from this page and other pages that have migrated. This is needed to prevent search engines from indexing URLs with tracking parameters. Search performance is not affected but tracking statistics will be skewed. Search clicks will be wrongly attributed to other marketing activities in Google Analytics or other tracking tools.",4

  SlpButton,

and update the props (if they've changed). I've removed the dataGaName and dataGALocation props on the button component, I felt they were specific to our product and not all consumers of slippers-ui would need them. I'm open to adding them back, but would prefer if we added them on instantiation.

1. Small update to the Country form field selector in order to keep a neutral stance on geo-politics
[Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349333#note_820089507) & [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/NxDRjifeVhRIVPFrTzeQdg/Free-Trial-updates?node-id=135%3A15433)
1. Navigation change from ""Login"" to profile icon - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/95836)
1. Login page Free Trial breakdown by date [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/muPxDrFbQdLLI9SAj8EXUK/Free-Trial-CTA-on-Sign-Up?node-id=119%3A10040) & ENG Issue
1. Removed pre-filled username from form field

Suggestions that still need work:

1. ""Just do it"" best practice [suggestions 1-6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/213):
   1. [ ] **Autofocus on the first field**
   1. [ ] **Use specialized mobile keyboards** - label textboxes: email (type=email), telephone numbers (type=tel), URLs (type=url), and numbers (type=num)
   1. [ ] **In line validation** - show the error as soon as the user has left the field (rather than on submit), and the error should be specific
   1. [ ] **Make labels clickable** - add the input element inside its respective label element
   1. [ ] **Let users see their password** - less onerous than requiring them to type it twice and allows the user to see if typed correctly
      * [Figma example](https://www.figma.com/file/NxDRjifeVhRIVPFrTzeQdg/Free-Trial-updates?node-id=44%3A6639)
   1. [ ] **Use button text to expose the value waiting for users on the other side** - Give the user context for their actions
      * On [registration page](https://gitlab.com/-/trial_registrations/new?glm_source=about.gitlab.com&glm_content=free-trial) change ""Continue"" to ""Create account""
      * On [start free trial page](https://gitlab.com/-/trial_registrations/new?glm_source=about.gitlab.com&glm_content=free-trial) change ""Continue"" to ""Start free trial""
1. ""Just do it"" best practice [suggestion 7](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/214)
   * **Replace Sign in/up with Login/Register**
1. ""Just do it"" best practice [suggestion 8](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/215)
   * **Move register option to top of login page and vice versa**
1. ""Just do it"" best practice [suggestion 9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/216)
   **Remember typed values between password attempts** - If the user enters their password unsuccessfully, they should not have to retype their email again. If we allow the user to see their password (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/213), don’t erase that either – they may want to check to see if they made a typo.
1. ""Just do it"" best practice [suggestion 10](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/217)
   * **Remember email on the “reset password"" page**

The font size for the page is too small to be legible and would require mobile visitors to “pinch to zoom” in order to read. 

**Solution** - After specifying a viewport for your web pages, set your font sizes to scale properly within the viewport.

#### Example Screenshot
URL - https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/benefits-of-using-version-control/

Screenshot taken with [Google Mobile-Friendly Test Tool](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=wkrb6lCQ4qF8Q_TZAa9fTQ).

### Affected URLs
Initial analysis indicates this error is predominantly found on URLs where the content elements such as tables and images are wider than the viewport.

This can be viewed on the about.gitlab.com [Google Search Console page experience report](https://search.google.com/u/1/search-console/mobile-usability/drilldown?resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.gitlab.com%2F&item_key=CAw).",4

### Solution
To fix this error, make sure the pages use relative width and position values for CSS elements, and make sure images can scale as well.

## Project Management

#### Please identify the DRI, stakeholders, subject matter experts, and their roles
Who should we be asking about questions and reviews?

* A directly responsible individual (DRI) is the singular person leading this project. We will ask them for clarifications, decisions, facilitation, or other assistance.
* A stakeholder is a person who represents an entity that the project impacts. We might ask about their needs, request their feedback, or inform them when the project is complete.
* Subject matter experts (SME) will be asked questions related to their expertise. Example subjects include design, development, copy, analytics, seo, social, ops, handbook, infrastructure, technologies like Marketo, etc.
* You may insert or remove as many lines as needed to list the relevant people involved with the project and their roles.

Dates without reason are difficult to prioritize. Without enough lead time we will be unable to meet your deadline. Example: Our due date is XXXX-XX-XX. We want to launch this page before a trade show happens on YYYY-YY-YY. We need a week to coordinate press before the event.

*If your ask requires multiple delivery deadlines, consider creating an epic with an issue for each deadline.*

Align with Navigation updates if the footer is included, if not let's aim for mid February

122798572,2023-01-31 22:49:42.506,GA4/GTM/OneTrust Blocker,"## Goal

**Context**

Google Tag Manager (GTM) by itself does NOT store any cookies on the browser. When tags on GTM are configured to send data to different platforms, such as Google Analytics, Linkedin, Google Ads, etc. - that's when cookies for the associated platform are stored on the browser. Each tag already contains a OneTrust condition, and will only fire if the user consents to the specific cookie category, such as functional, performance/analytics, or targeting.

On a related note, we've added the gtag.js code update for GA4's consent feature. This update will send a signal to the browser's dataLayer regarding the user's default consent status based on their country. For example, by default (no user interaction with the consent banner at this point), a user from a European country will NOT be tracked if they take no action (clicking ""X"" on the OneTrust banner).

The gtag.js code update enables the machine learning capabilities for GA4 to fill in the gap where users deny tracking (by default or by choice).

[More Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i66ayUZTVuff41w6IKPVeSJ_pwL1nIX4pQZbF9Gpcro/edit#)

#### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *When a user visits the site w*
* **Motivation**: *We want to load GTM at all times and prevent OneTrust from blocking *
* **Outcome**: *So we can ...*

#### Please provide more information related to this request

In attempt to prevent OT from blocking GTM we tried using `data-ot-ignore` and `optanon-category-C0001` from OneTrust's Docs. Both of these slowed down traffic to GA. A ticket was submitted to OneTrust support where they suggested that we focus on our script ordering since OneTRust loads after GTM in our codebase and that may potentially be preventing their auto blocking classes from working. In attempt to do we've tried:

- **Placing OneTrust above GTM in the head file**: no effect [[MR]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/108574)
- **Using the addEventListener**: Using the addEventListener method to attach a load event listener to the OneTrust script, and then include the Google Tag Manager script inside the event listener function
this prevented GTM from loading at all [[MR]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/1499)
- **Changing GTM’s Triggers to wait for OneTrust** [[MR]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/118462)
This was suggested by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75073704/onetrust-script-executing-after-google-tag-manager). By adding another trigger that onetrust fires when it's loaded and by adding an exception to existing pageview triggers to not fire if onetrust's consent cookies are missing or denied [[MR]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/118462)
- **Increasing time interval on GTM attribute `wait_for_update`**:  no effect [[MR]](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/118797)
- **Loading OneTrust from GTM:** broke the functionality in the cookie banner and prevented user preferences from persisting [(shown here)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/uploads/e582c4be996eae761a87d0ebb8fa65d7/video2798811226.mp4)
- **Removing GTM from the source of all cookies containing ""gtm"" individually in the OneTrust Dashboard**: _waiting for response from OT support_

122761110,2023-01-31 14:06:13.508,ENG: Refactor Software Faster Carousel Component,"[Software Faster page](https://about.gitlab.com/software-faster/)

The current carousel does not render all slide content on the page at once, but renders the content for the slide that's visible. This has made it difficult to render the video on slide two on page load, which is needed for Vimeo analytics to be pushed up to the dataLayer. 

Let's refactor the carousel component so that all slide content is rendered in the DOM, but is properly hidden until selected.

122306871,2023-01-23 14:37:28.354,Netlify CMS authentication for only members of repository,"## Goal
For only members of a public GitLab repository to be able to access the Netlify CMS admin. 

For our use case, this means `about.gitlab.com/admin `

Currently anyone with a GitLab account can login to the admin. We'd like to restrict access to www-gitlab-com project members. 

Here's [the slack thread in #marketing](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0AKZRSQ5/p1674306562076699) that spawned this issue.

Although any account can log in, their actions are still restricted based on their permissions. For example users could see ""draft posts"" which are just public MRs - already visible via gitlab.com's normal UI - but they wouldn't be able to merge without Maintainer permissions. **There is no current security risk**, just confusing behavior.

#### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *When anyone tries to login to the `about.gitlab.com/admin`, only those who are project members of [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com) should be able to authenticate successfully.*
* **Motivation**: *We want to have the admin only available to GitLab team members.*
* **Outcome**: *So that non team-members don't have access to an ""admin"" site.*

### Final Copy: 
1. H1: DevOps tools landscape (should be sentence case instead of title case as it currently is)
2. H5: As The DevSecOps Platform, GitLab’s focus is on providing a single application with best-in-class capabilities for the entire DevOps lifecycle.
3. Body-2: There are a ton of DevOps tools to choose from, many of which specialize in a few capabilities. We’ve ranked the tools for each stage of the DevOps lifecycle, starting with the most mature solutions. For more info on the maturity of GitLab and other key competitors, check out our DevOps maturity comparison chart.
4. Add a title to the table - H4: Top tools for each stage of the DevOps lifecycle

116786364,2022-10-12 22:19:20.145,ENG: Solutions / Change 'Take GitLab for a Spin' copy,"## Goal
I would like to iterate on the line `Take GitLab for a Spin` which will improve clicks as measured by metrics.

This section has the lowest engagement on the page ([source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1375#note_1118351358)) so we would like to test an alternative line of copy. I hypothesize that 'Take GitLab for a Spin' is both too vague and too aggressive. I would like to replace the line with `Try Ultimate for Free` which is a more clear and more succinct call to action.

114538762,2022-09-06 22:33:44.138,Contact Page: Marketo Form Fields for Google Analytics,"## Goal
Related: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1260#note_1086859242

Marketo forms has hidden `<input>` fields to capture the Google Analytics client ID and tracking ID.

**Method** <br/>
This script on Tag Manager fires on DOM Ready across all about.gitlab.com pages, which retrieves the IDs and appends them on the form upon a form submission:<br/>

**Example:**<br/>
On the https://about.gitlab.com/sales/ page, you can see the `gaclientid__c` and `gatrackid__c` values populate the `<input>` fields upon a form submit: <br/>
<img src=""/uploads/4330521db48d740c182b192c7fec5791/qa.gif"" width=""900"">


**Engineering Issue**<br/>
There are two forms on this page: https://about.gitlab.com/company/contact/ with duplicated scripts for each form (not to mention the script on Tag Manager as well). Only the Newsletter script works, the Security one doesn't. 

Are there too many duplicated scripts? Or is the Security script not working properly? Also, should I pause the script on Tag Manager from firing on this page?

125604308,2023-03-21 22:11:50.439,Brand marketing landing page refresh,"## Goal
We would like to refresh (not redesign) our brand marketing landing page with some small adjustments ([figma comp from brand design team for direction](https://www.figma.com/file/cpxpcnUjCEDH87otFP42zZ/Brand-strategy-landing-page?node-id=313%3A1599&t=vxdM0abipJEBkjqJ-1)) to better align with campaign messaging and improve engagement with our content.

Adjustments: 
- Hero: Swap out the Hero image with new creative
- Hero: Update the Watch Video CTA and link (Pending final link to ""What Is GitLab?"" new video).
- Hero: remove the ""free trial"" link to focus user engagement on the Watch video CTA and scroll down the page.
- Customer Stories: Move this module up above the logo strip to encourage discovery and engagement.
- Customer Stories: Change the module layout to present all three customer stories on the page. 

**Context for surfacing customer stories**: 
Based on 3 months of historical brand landing page data (q4FY23 - Q1FY24) our top 5 page clicks are:

1. Header / Free Trial
2. Hero / Watch Video CTA
3. Hero / Free Trial
4. Header / Site Search
5. In-line / GitLab Homepage

**Awareness level content:**

11. Read the Blog (Cadence is Everything)
12. Hackerone customer story

With the suggested minimal edits above, we believe that awareness level content will get an increased number of clicks. We will monitor this iteration and measure the results. 

#### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *Live April 5th, 2023 (possibly sooner, if edit proves minimal)*
* **Motivation**: *We will be featuring our new What is GitLab video and driving traffic to customer stories through a brand ad campaign as soon as this is refreshed.*

Please help implement click tracking on the Solutions page:
1. Update the `data-ga-body` attribute on links to `data-ga-location` on the Solutions page 
2. The card links (documentation, pricing tiers) will need specific attributes. Add the following attributes (please see the /features page as an example for coding): `data-ga-features`, `data-ga-features-sub`, `data-ga-features-sub-card`, `data-ga-name`, `data-ga-location`. 
3. Add the data attributes for anchoring links where `data-ga-location=""anchor""`.

123490671,2023-02-10 16:52:03.549,Investigate reoccurring artifact upload failures,"## Goal
In the last sprint, we have seen three separate incidents where the pipeline in www is failing because of the buyer-experience job. We have mitigated these incidents, but need to investigate a root cause. 


#### Details and Timeline

Thurs, Feb 2nd - [Incident-8354](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1870): Pipelines for the buyer-experience job started 503-ing, implying ""no access"" to the artifact. After declaring a [prod incident](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/8354), it was discovered that the buyer experience repository had been made private, meaning that the artifacts were being uploaded somewhere inaccessible. Changing the repo to public, and re-uploading a new artifact, seemed to fix the problem. 

Fri, Feb 3rd - [Incident-8354 part 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/1874): Same job in www starts failing, this time due to a 404 (file not found). After checking the difference between a recent successful ""pages"" deploy job in buyer experience, and comparing it to the most recent ""pages"" deploy job, we noticed that the runner was a private runner. We removed all private runners, and re-uploaded a new artifact. This seemed to fix the problem, and we assumed that the private runners were added to our repo when it had been made private yesterday. 

Fri, Feb 10th - Same as last week, the artifact starts 404-ing. The repo is public, there are no private runners. Looking at the last ""pages"" deploy in buyer experience, it was the automatic changelog job. I created a new MR, merged it in order to create a new artifact, and went over and re-ran the failed jobs in buyer experience, which seemed to fix the problem. 

#### Theories
Simply due to the fact that the changelog job had been run immediately prior to each of the 3 incidents, we may need to investigate how it may be affecting our CI. Especially since we're seeing these 404 failures on Friday's (the changelog script has [recently been changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/1642) to run every second Friday). My instinct is to let the job run on it's own in 2 weeks and see if we run into problems, or manually run the job and keep an eye on www pipelines. 

**If this is urgent, what is the business need for the urgency?**
- [x]  Yes: This blocks all MRs from building & deploying in the handbook, blog, and some marketing web pages. 
- [ ]  No

123400341,2023-02-09 22:36:47.192,[ENG] Identify Enterprise user and display MVC variation in navigation,"## Goal

To utilize the [Demandbase API](https://support.demandbase.com/hc/en-us/sections/360011444531-API-Documentation) to identify if a visitor is coming from an Enterprise organization. They will be identified if:

- They have an existing Demandbase cookie set
- That cookie was mapped to a company
- If their IP address has been identified to obtain company identification

If the user is identified as Enterprise, we'll display a very MVC to the navigation. This subtle change in the navigation will be tiny - such as slightly different text on a single nav item. 

The goal of the issue is to simply prove that we can personalize the navigation based on visitor identification using Demandbase. If we can prove successful here, we'll ask our product designers to create two navigation variations for a larger iteration.

123392410,2023-02-09 19:26:46.866,Create GDK cookie to recognize logged in user on marketing site,"## Goal

We would like to create a first party cookie in the product that will enable the marketing site to recognize a logged in Gitlab user.

### Engineering Notes

The user's session ID can be stored in a cookie on the client-side, and sent with each request to the server. The server can then look up the user's session in the database(or API) to determine if they are logged in or not.

This solution was also suggested by a Staff Support Engineer in the `#g_manage_auth` slack channel

#### How

1. **Assign a unique session ID to each user when they log in**: When a user logs in, generate a unique session ID for them and store it in a cookie on their device.
1. **Store the session ID in a shared database(or API):** Store the session ID in a database that can be accessed by both repositories. This allows us verify the user's login status by checking if their session ID is present in the database.
1. **Verify the user's login status with each request**: On each request from the user's device, both repositories can check the session ID in the cookie against the session ID stored in the database. If the session IDs match, the user is considered to be logged in.
1. **Update the cookie when the user logs out**: When the user logs out, you can delete their session ID from the database and remove the cookie from their device.

#### Problems

1. Potential scaling issues: performance issues may arise with a larger user base but this could be mitigated by sharding
1. Latency
1. Security? May need to flag that team for awareness and implementing some sort of encryption for the cookies
1. Maintenance? May need to onboard more people in GDK to maintain this
1. Cookies are client-side so the user maybe clear the cookies at any point. We should implement a fallback method like a session time-out that requires the user to log back in after \~12-24 hours

110570429,2022-06-22 18:11:38.647,GA4: Content Security Policy,"## Goal
Related: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/922#note_1000045146

Events are not sending to GA4 on gitlab.com. This is the JS error message I receive:
> it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: ""connect-src 'self'

@tywilliams 's recommendation:
> To resolve that, we'll need to update the content security policy in `lib/gitlab/content_security_policy/directives.rb`, [similar to how it was updated in this MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/6bb099039e20bca19de5f61ecf98bc51e0a3c858/#3fe66e137a17241d7e683542368b77aa4f8c7b8d_11_11) and make it compatible with whatever GA4 needs, [which I think is listed here](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/csp#google_analytics_4_google_analytics).

We would like to reorder our search results for our commonly searched terms which will improve our clickthrough rate. This is a small test to see if improving our search results for customer sought-out topics and content (ex: CI/CD, DevOps, etc) will keep users more engaged. 

## Background
From our [metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/994#note_982711036), customers with a strong intention of making a search tend to navigate to a lot more pages than the average visit. Additionally, studies show how optimizing your internal search not only [improves usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/), but also significantly [increases conversion rates](https://econsultancy.com/is-site-search-less-important-for-niche-retailers/).

## Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *When I am searching for a customer related topic (ex: CI/CD, DevOps, etc)*
* **Motivation**: *I want to see the most relevant information first*
* **Outcome**: *So I can quickly learn about how GitLab can solve my DevOps problem*

110262862,2022-06-16 21:33:05.033,Bug: Features LP - Pipeline security link points to a 404 page,"### Describe the Bug

Clicking on `Pipelines security` from https://about.gitlab.com/features/?stage=verify leads to a [404 page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.html). Unsure which docs page it should point to.

Also, should it read 'Pipeline security' without the plural 's'?

110194972,2022-06-15 20:59:51.302,Implement and Measure MR by Type,"## Goal
After sitting in the Cross-functional prioritization adoption AMA AMER/EMEA discussion 6/15 8:30am Pacific, I learned a lot on how product teams allocate work. [Here's that agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iobEuygqGi3L4Lczu72zoKuzuL_8fHmUpN7xQzZZGs/edit?usp=sharing) & [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w-4-DsUaIgbMXHF2f3rxjzxfpSa8OdvA/view?usp=sharing). 

To support [GitLab's long-term product health and stability](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-prioritization.html), teams are asked to plan their milestones with an appropriate mix of `type::feature`, `type::maintenance`, and `type:bug` work. MR Type labels help us report what we're working on to leadership in a way that's consistent across the engineering department.

This issue is for aligning with the Digital Experience team on these items: 

1. Introduce merge request types for the Digital Experience team to align with the [Cross Functional Prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-prioritization.html) process of product groups. We have some merge request types being implement as part of the approval process being worked on [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/epics/135). Should we add additional types for bugs, maintenance, and features? 
1. Create a dashboard for MR by Type for Digital Experience. Dashboards listing MR by Type were created and added to every group for product as part of [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/13294). Here is the [Merge Request Types Detail periscope dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/976854/Merge-Request-Types-Detail) for product. 
1. Update [Repository Health Days and Weeks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/#repository-health-day) with our new process

### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: *Digital Experience has no way to measure MRs or what type of work it's contributing to*
* **Motivation**: *We want to implement MR types and measure them*
* **Outcome**: *So we can support GitLab's long-term product health and stability*

109568601,2022-06-03 15:24:20.382,ENG: Release Post template - Brand refresh,"## Goal
We would like to update the release post template to be better inlined with our refreshed brand.  This is similar to the blog refresh where we need to make sure the styles work for previous posts as well.   

All changes with this issue should revolve around the styles and theme of the template. 

Slack thread [here](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CN8AVSFEY/p1652798710579189)

### Jobs To Be Done
* **Situation**: Our release template theme is not on brand
* **Motivation**: We want to have this before the June 22nd release
* **Outcome**: When someone goes to our release page the brand matches our new brand refresh

126989735,2023-04-20 14:04:55.659,[ENG] hreflang attribute MVC2,"## Goal
We would like iterated on the href lang attributes to robot directives of our localized pages. For this iteration we need to:

* The current `hreflang` URLs are ouputted as relative paths, ie `/de-de/sales` this needs to change to absolute paths ie `https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/sales/`
* Add missing trailing slash (/) at the end of each `hreflang` URL to prevent redirects
* The language pages have 2 robot directives in the `head`, `index,follow` and `noindex,nofollow`. This will give conflicting directives to search engines.

This effects all localized pages: 

* https://about.gitlab.com/enterprise/ (relative URLs used: /de-de/enterprise, /enterprise, /fr-fr/enterprise, /jp-jp/enterprise)
* https://about.gitlab.com/sales/ (relative URLs used: /de-de/sales, /sales, /fr-fr/sales, /jp-jp/sales)
* https://about.gitlab.com/small-business/ (relative URLs used: /de-de/small-business, /small-business, /fr-fr/small-business, /jp-jp/small-business)

126559238,2023-04-12 17:23:35.217,MVC5 Navigation - Hover effect on links,"### Describe the Bug
The 'GitLab Ultimate' and 'GitLab Premium' link hover effect happens at the same time. We will require the chevron hover effect to only happen once a user hovers over a single link.

**The correct behaviour should be as follows:**

- User hovers solutions navigation
- User hovers the 'Try our pricing calculator' or 'Pricing plans' section in the navigation and the background changes to purple
- Clicking on the section should not open any of the links in the section
- User hovers a link in the section and the hover effect of the chevron activates
- User can select a single link item and be taken to that page

**Example of current bug, with both chevrons moving at the same time once the section is hovered:**

## Code to add to each page

The following code must be added to https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/.

```
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/' hreflang=x-default rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/ja-jp/teamops/' hreflang=ja-jp rel=alternate />

<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/teamops/' hreflang=de rel=alternate />
```

For the language pages eg `/fr-fr/teamops/` the `hreflang` implementation should look like this:

```
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/teamops/' hreflang=x-default rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/ja-jp/teamops/' hreflang=ja-jp rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/teamops/' hreflang=fr-fr rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/fr-fr/teamops/' hreflang=fr rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/teamops/' hreflang=de-de rel=alternate />
<link href='https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/teamops/' hreflang=de rel=alternate />
```

The same format should be applied to every localized version of our pages.

108033068,2022-05-04 19:02:20.269,GA4: Ecommerce dataLayer,"## Goal
Update the existing checkout and transaction dataLayers to include the new GA4 dataLayer syntax. We will be parallel tracking ecommerce events into both Universal GA and GA4 until EOY '22, which is why we need both dataLayer events. 

New dimensions: 
1. Recently, the namespace id was passed into dimension 36 for each transaction. This will be `item_category3` within the GA4 dataLayer. 
2. Users can reach the Checkout page from about.gitlab.com/pricing/ or gitlab.com (group billing section). We need to distinguish where the user came from. Adding the referrer (previous page's hostname) into a new variable would allow us to see the marketing site's impact on users entering checkout. This will be `item_category4` within the GA4 dataLayer. 

**Checkout** 

Update the existing Checkout dataLayer script to include the new GA4 syntax. Lowercase values.
```
<script>
dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null }); 

// existing Universal GA code 
dataLayer.push({
  'event':'EECCheckout',
  'currencyCode': 'USD',
  'ecommerce': {
    'checkout':{
      'actionField': {'step': 1},
      'products': [{
        'name': 'GitLab Premium',
        [...]
      }]
    }
  }
});

  event: 'begin_checkout',
  ecommerce: {
    currency: 'USD',
    items: [
    {
      item_id: '[product id]', //0001 for ultimate, 0002 for premium
      item_name: '[product name]', //ultimate, premium
      item_category: '[product category]', //devops, cicd
      item_category2: '[saas or self managed]',
      item_category3: '[namespace id]', 
      item_category4: '[previous page's hostname]', //about.gitlab.com or gitlab.com

      quantity: [product amount] //1, 200
    }
    ]
  }
});
</script>
```

**Transaction**

Update the existing Transaction dataLayer script to include the new GA4 syntax. Lowercase values.
```
<script>
dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null }); 

// existing Universal GA code
dataLayer.push({

108032988,2022-05-04 18:59:26.005,GA4: OneTrust Google Consent Mode,"## Goal
Google Consent Mode enables the machine learning modeling features within GA4, Google Ads, and Campaign Manager to fill in the data gap for users who opt out via OneTrust cookie consent. 

Step by step implementation guide: https://community.cookiepro.com/s/article/UUID-d81787f6-685c-2262-36c3-5f1f3369e2a7?language=en_US

1. Place the default gtag script _before_ the Google Tag Manager and OneTrust scripts across all pages. 
```
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}

  gtag('consent', 'default', {
    'analytics_storage': 'denied',
    'ad_storage': 'denied',
    'functionality_storage': 'denied',
    'region': ['EU', 'UK', 'PE', 'RU'],
    'wait_for_update': 500
  });
  gtag('consent', 'default', {
    'analytics_storage': 'granted',
    'ad_storage': 'granted',
    'functionality_storage': 'granted',
    'wait_for_update': 500
  });
</script>

<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-XXXXXX');</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->

<!-- OneTrust Cookies Consent Notice start -->
<script src=""https://cdn.cookielaw.org/scripttemplates/otSDKStub.js""  type=""text/javascript"" charset=""UTF-8"" data-domain-script=""XXXXXX"" ></script>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
function OptanonWrapper() { }
</script>
<!-- OneTrust Cookies Consent Notice end -->
```

2. Enable Google Consent Mode on OneTrust settings for each Geolocation Rules. Publish. This will dynamically update the consent values from the gtag script (code above ^^^) base on the actual user's consent.

OneTrust automatically sends events to Google Analytics from the cookie banner script. These events are labeled as an interaction event on Google Analytics, which is skewing bounce rate and creating a ""not set"" landing page. This can happen when an interaction event fires before or without a pageview. Typically, we would set the event as non-interaction on Google Tag Manager. However, these events are coming directly from OT, so we cannot adjust the event.

107297281,2022-04-27 14:22:43.073,A11y > Navigation unusable by keyboard,"## Problem

**Navigation is unusable by keyboard.**

- While it's possible to open a parent nav item with the keyboard, it is not possible to access any of the expanded navigation links or even close the menu, making the rest of the page useless as the focus moves behind an open navigation panel.
- Navigation isn't coded correctly. It uses an unordered list `<ul>` with buttons `<button>` as the child elements, but only list items are allowed so this also fails markup validation.
- The **Support** dropdown can't be closed via keyboard, which also prevent focus from moving efficiently.

## Solution

- Use correct HTML semantics.
- Ensure all functionality can be done via keyboard.
- Ensure focus order is correct.
- Ensure elements don't obscure other elements that can receive focus.

![CleanShot_2022-04-27_at_09.21.17](/uploads/3ee1be62a44122f66955eb90b9bd1bdb/CleanShot_2022-04-27_at_09.21.17.mp4)

## MVC 1

First iteration MVC can be seen in this [merged MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/24).

## What has been done

- All unordered lists have been updated to only include list items as direct children elements.
- Focus attributes of the footer section have been updated to be inaccesible whenever the Menu is open.

## What still needs to be done

- Although the links on the footer are hidden whenever the nav menu is open, as a user I cannot reach the submenus directly afterwards as the focus incorrectly goes to the top of the browser to start the page again. [This behavior can be seen here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/24#note_966838793).
- The **Support** dropdown can only be closed by clicking `Support` again or navigating the whole menu. We would need to add a `Close` button inside that dropdown to have an actionable element with which we could close it with the keyboard.

## MVC2

For the MVC2, an npm package [was tested here ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/34) but failed to work on production so it was rolled back and focus trap was implemented from scratch [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation/-/merge_requests/45).

## What has been done

The focus trap was created in the `navigation-desktop-menu.vue` file using DOM references. The npm packages for the focus trap have been removed from the repo. Focus trap should be working as expected now.

## What still needs to be done

- When `Close` button is clicked, focus should go to the latest focused nav item instead of the Support buttton (first button on page).",5

- [ ] @mduque-ext started a [discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/merge_requests/433#note_921322831):  (+1 comment)

    > @dennischarukulvanich tagging you in this MR which has [the public sector page](https://feature-quotes-carousel.about.gitlab-review.app/solutions/public-sector/). 
    > 
    > Could you please take a look and make sure we are not missing important Analytics stuff that should be in place? Thank you very much in advance!

We would like to address feedback received concerning the GA tags and Analytics elements that should be in place for the `/solutions/public-sector` page

Pages involved: 
`/solutions/public-sector`

**@dennischarukulvanich original feedback for the Public Sector Page:**


Update all `data-ga-location` values to align with section name. The reason for this is to distinguish identical links. For example, there are 2 ""hardened"" links under solutions block and value prop.

* [x] hero
* [x] benefits
* [ ] quotes carousel
* [x] solutions block
* [ ] value prop
* [x] case studies
* [x] resource cards

Update ""Start your free trial"" CTA button:

* [x] `data-ga-name=""free trial""`

Under ""Security. Efficiency. Control."", add data-ga-name/location to each Learn More link.

* [x] `<a data-ga-name=""reduce security learn more"" data-ga-location=""benefits"">`
* [x] `<a data-ga-name=""free up learn more"" data-ga-location=""benefits"">`
* [x] `<a data-ga-name=""modernize learn more"" data-ga-location=""benefits"">`

Add these data attributes to each toggle div section:  

* [x] `<div data-inbound-analytics=""public-sector-leap-target"" data-toggle-group=""example: Reduce security and compliance risk"" data-ga-toggle=""expand or collapse"" class=""accordion""`

Add data attributes to the ""Trusted by government"" carousel per slide  

* [x] `<div data-ga-carousel=""example: public-sector us army"" class=""quotes-carousel__quote"">`

Update ""Off-line Environment"" learn more link:

* [x] `data-ga-name=""offline environment""`

Add attributes to ""Low to High Environment"":

* [x] `data-ga-name=""low to high"" data-ga-location=""quotes carousel""`

Add attributes to ""GitLab meets NIST SSDF 1.1 guidance"" and ""hardened""

* [x] `data-ga-name=""gitlab meets nist"" data-ga-location=""value prop""`
* [x] `data-ga-name=""hardened"" data-ga-location=""value prop""`

* [x] I noticed the ""All Case Studies"" link has an `<a>` tag nested inside another `<a>` tag. Not sure if this is a mistake, but Google Tag Manager will target the inner `<a>` tag, so the data-attributes will need to go on both `<a>` tags.

* [x] Same as above for the case study learn more links. 
* [x] Also, need to update data-ga-name from ""learn more"" to include the customer's name, ie. ""us army cyber school learn more"".

Add data attributes to the ""View all resources"" link:

* [x] `data-ga-name=""view all resources"" data-ga-location=""resource cards""`",1

Now that we have [fixed the 404 files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/102323), some users may have cached assets with the broken favicon in their browsers. 

This will resolve over time, but we can also cache bust the old favicon with a query string at the end of the assets. I will also check to see if Nuxt has a conventional way to do this - most CSS/JS files with Nuxt get a cache bust at build time, but these are hardcoded strings, so we may have to do it the old fashioned way.",1

106547472,2022-04-12 19:52:15.757,Turn off OneTrust in review app,"OneTrust is taking up to 12 seconds to load and then fail to load on the review apps for Buyer Experience.

My hypothesis is that's because OneTrust is not configured to work in our review environments, which means it takes a long time to try and connect to the OneTrust server, never gets what it needs, and ends up bailing out. 

I don't think we need OneTrust in review apps. I would prefer to have it to emulate prod environment, but if it's not configured for this at the moment, I'd rather just disable it in review apps so we don't artificially slow down those pages. 

Fortunately, this is not an issue that makes its way to production, because OneTrust is correctly configured for `about.gitlab.com`, so this is a pretty low priority thing. I just want to clean it up before a lot of folks are walking through the refresh branch and wondering why it's so slow. 

Once I remove it, I will triple-check that it's still loading in production, where we absolutely need to have it.",1

This was started as part of #623 but the design been changed to match the Homepage case studies section.

** Note: Save the existing Case Studies component code, as we may need to reuse it in the future

With that said, we can probably steal the Homepage case studies code (or use the component entirely if it fits our needs!).

I have done research into salient events towards conversion of our product.

This issue will track that work, and may be promoted to an epic if need be.

At a high level, here's what I think needs to happen:

- [x] Update the fonts on landing page
- [x] Update the fonts on blog posts
- [x] Grab Inter fonts from Google Fonts
- [x] Remove old colors on landing page
- [x] Update new colors on landing page
- [x] Remove old colors on blog posts
- [x] Update new colors on blog posts
- [x] Isolate changes by pulling them out to a separate style sheet and loading it in those templates (just cleanup work, really)
- [x] Check for substantial regressions and fix them

Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/HdsUOq4gDMjaI1kkhwUWNN/Blog-LP-Refresh?node-id=5%3A1421

I'll come through and enumerate those as well. 

Then I'll loop in @mpreuss22 and @jhalloran to make sure I'm on the right track. Finally I'll reach out to @vsilverthorne to let her know what's getting impacted (there should be no workflow change - just a change in the output of these pages). 

I'm going to start from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/slippers-ui/-/merge_requests/168, which is the brand update in the Slippers repository, and identify what changes I can make over in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com to match those.

MR for this will be at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/101723 to start. I think we can get this done in one.

#### Blog landing page

- [x] Change ""Subscribe"" title to ""sign up for GitLab's twice-monthly newsletter""
- [x] Add form field label for ""Enter your email address"" (Requested in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/6274)
- [x] Add ""abc@xyz.com"" placeholder text (Requested in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/6274)
- [x] Add title copy to search bar ""Search the blog""
- [x] Update search placeholder copy to ""search""
- [x] Add YouTube social option (figma file says LinkedIn, but we already had that)
