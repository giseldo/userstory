Having different package version installed than required in the script makes problems. We need a solution, where the executable scripts (such as data processing operations, models) define what requirements they have. 

This should ideally not be as a separate requirements file but withing the script as (possibly) annotations. 

We should start by drawing how this could be done.

30688982,2020-02-12 19:00:38.478,Separate Data Pipeline input and output data,"### Observed behaviour

When creating a pipeline (eg. data processing pipeline, data visualization or experiment), the resulting branch that is created contains from its start all files present in the origin branch. 


### Expected behaviour

We are currently using branches to store the output of a branch. As long as we have this system, the origin files should not be in the newly created pipeline branch (such as data-pipeline/XXX branch).


### Steps to reproduce

Open dev environment, start a processing pipeline, navigate to data instance (or in gitlab backend) to see the content of this branch.


### Terminology

@rainerkern do you think this ticket makes sense in the perspective of (hopefully) switching to a better storing mechanism (buckets)? 


### Solution
The technical implementation of this can look similar to how Maven does it. In Maven, there exists a general output folder and every script generates a separate folder within that. Subsequent scripts can then easily access the previous results.

We can (and probably should) do something similar. For example, if a pipeline consists of three scripts:

1. Every Data Pipeline script per default needs an input and an output folder.
2. The EPF (`mlreef.yaml`) takes the original `data` folder as input for the first script in the pipeline and directs the output to a temporary location (e.g. `output/1`)
3. The EPF uses `output/1` as input for the second script and directs its output to `output/2`
4. Then the EPF uses `output/2` as input for the third script and directs its output to `output/3`
5. Then, at last, the `data` folder is cleared and the contents from `output/3` are moved to `data` and subsequently persisted as the Data Instance

**Mixing Data:**
If the user decides that he wants to original input data and the output data mixed together, in step `5` the input data is **NOT** deleted from the `data` folder

This functionality can also be added for each step. So the data from each step is propagated to the output folder

@cpmlreef create designs in frontend.

**Storage:**
This description is still completely agnostic of the type of storage that will be used; be it S3, FTP, or GIT.",6

If we save the exact docker image tags which were used during a run for Frontend and Backend images, this would allow us to trigger the Infrastructure Pipeline from the Frontend Project as well as the backend Project and only change out the new parts; A Frontend trigger would update only the Frontend on the PROD environment without touching the backend.


### Technical Solution

* [ ]  If useful: Add documentation to the readme or the code


### Terminology
* **Instance/Environment**: A separate ""server"" running on EC2 hosting a complete, independent installation of all microservices and databases of MLReef 
* **DEV/develop Environment:** The Environment used by developers for development. Can break at any time.
* **TEST Environment:** A more stable environment used for User Acceptance Testing. Should be quite stable already. `DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST`
* **PROD/production:** The one and only real production environment
* **staging:** Not a real Environment but rather a temporary place to stage new versions for production deployment. `DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST`
* **PipelineId:** A globally unique integer, automatically generated by Gitlab, reasonably human-readable, and increases in number.

30338847,2020-02-03 20:22:26.700,Better AMI (Amazon Machine Image) for Gitlab Runners,"### Problem to Solve
Gitlab Runners can be deployed in two different modes. The single runner which just accepts a job and executes it directly. And the multi-runner; which uses a separate driver to create AWS EC2 instances and execute jobs on them. This would offer us much more parallel computing power.

The driver uses a configurable Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to create the new EC2 instance.

In the Frontend project, the multi runner configuration exists, but the single runner config is used. It is located inside deployment script script -> [src/bin/deploy.sh](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/frontend/-/blob/develop/src/bin/deploy.sh)

In order to be able to harness the power of GPUs in (future) elastically deployed Gitlab runners we need an AMI which already contains NVIDIA Cuda drivers.

### Technical Solution
**Preferably find** or otherwise create a more specialised AMI (Amazon Machine Image) which already has the following software preinstalled:
* Docker in the newest version
* Nvidia Cuda drivers

look to the [ec2 startup script](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/frontend/-/blob/develop/src/bin/startup.sh) for guidance

30333722,2020-02-03 17:37:38.025,Make Develop instance more accessible for developers,"### Problem to Solve
As a Developer, I like to use my locally running frontend while connected to the `develop` instance of the backend and Gitlab.

Currently, when doing so, CORS errors are thrown by the remote backend.

### Technical Solution
* [x]  Add documentation in the Frontend's getting started guide how to connect your local instance to the DEVELOP infrastructure
* [x]  Implement CORS headers in the Backend #280

30171137,2020-01-31 22:54:25.498,Integration and Proxy as MicroService-Holder,"### Problem to Solve

In the end, we want to have a working infrastructure hosted on AWS with a certain URL.
Some ports are publicly available, others must be present for maintenance (ssh).

We have to assert the following is fixed:
* frontend is available as HTTP/HTTPS
* backend is available as HTTP/HTTPS
* gitlab is available as HTTP/HTTPS
* No cors violations are happening
* frontend can talk to backend & gitlab
* backend can talk to gitlab

I propose the following **Solution A**:
* have the reverse proxy as the single domain entry point **mlreef.com**
* proxies mlreef.com/api to backend:8080/api 
* proxies mlreef.com/gitlab to gitlab:80/gitlab with relativeRootUrl /gitlab
* configure gitlab to use the relativeRootUrl /gitlab to maintain proper redirects (mlreef.com/gitlab/user/signin, e.g.)
* frontend uses just /gitlab as the gitlab root URL, with the proxy active URLs get a proper rewrite. 
  * Attention: In my understanding, the API would be on /gitlab/api/v4 instead of OTHER_HOST:PORT/api/v4, be aware of that extra /gitlab in that URL
* frontend uses just /api as the service root URL, with the proxy active URLs get a proper rewrite. 
* All services can run with http. The reverse proxy can be configured to act as an https endpoint

### Technical Solution
> Add technical implementation details and the results of the tickets discussion here.

* [x] Discuss this and read into reverse-proxying
* [x] Set gitlab relativeRootUrl  in docker-compose
* [x] fix nginx config: add /gitlab to gitlab:/gitlab instead of /gitlab to gitlab:/
* [x] adapt prodution frontend to just use /gitlab and dont need any root url variables (Also: CORS!)
* [x] frontend should be able to choose different url when run in development

30108050,2020-01-30 11:19:36.389,Backend: Redesign Experiment domain model,"### Problem to Solve


There was an error/misunderstanding in the backend data model.

It is not: Run experiments which are pipelines on data, but run DataPipelines on DataRepository to DataInstance with cleansed Data.
Run Experiment (just choose files and Model) to create Experiment output

* Pipeline-DataInstance: DataRepository + DataPipeline-Configuration -> (DataInstance - Execution) -> DataInstance
* Adhoc-DataInstance: DataRepository + DataPipeline-Configuration -> (DataInstance - Execution) -> DataInstance
* DataRepository + DataInstance + Experiment-Configuration -> (Experiment - Execution) -> Experiment

An Experiment is both an Experiment-Pipeline-Configuration and its Experiment-Instance. The output can be a model an some Files

Experiment = ExperimentPipeline + ExperimentInstance
* has a name and generated slug
* has experiment.mlreef.yaml
* points to DataInstance or DataRepository
a) DataInstance
 * choose files
 * configuration is transient, configure Model directly
b) DataRepository+branch
 * choose files
 * configure Model directly, 
 * just info about files and branch name

b) advanced parameters: these have preset values which are defined in the data datatypes.js (location FE web?). If the values have been changed while running a parameter, these values need to be overwritten by the values in the experiment/xxx yaml file.

The tests are currently not working for the fileView set, the error is because of the configuration of the test which is not receiving a store object.

### Technical solution
Utilize the newly added store factory to retrieve a store object, which provides an initial state and lets the test run.

### Feature
As a user I want to access the output files of a trained model. These are noremally the model itself and other relevant files, such as CSV files measuring the training performance. 

As a user i want to discover the files and also be able to delete the files (in case i do need to free storage space).

The user can access the files via the FE through the experiment details view: 


### Technical solution

The API provided by gitlab **should** be enough for implementing this functionality.

We need to be able to create a new ML project (repository). 

This form is very similar to how GitLab does it. We, in addition, add the ""choose data type"" function, as this will define, in what category the project can be found in the market place. 

As of now I think the best way to do this is by adding tags to the project: e.g. image, video as tags. 


### Technical solution

* [ ]  Update the [handbook page](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/blob/master/handbook/engineering/sops/create-gitlab-project.md) on creating projects (delete the Machine Learning projects section)

To recreate a data pipeline a user shall simply click the ""view pipeline"" button in the data instance view and be directed to an automatically pre-filled data pipeline view like this one, where all parameters and operations are selected according to the saved config file: 


### Technical Implementation

* [x]  Add at least one unit test
* [ ]  If useful: Add documentation to the readme or the code

* There are two alternatives for solving this issue:
1. Parse the .mlreef.yml file to get the operations, folder selected and parameters entered by the user.
2. Persist pipelines related information in a database(maybe a snippet), so that the pipeline view can be rebuilt from that source.

Additional notes:

Files API has a limit of 100 files, therefore to calculate a folder size cannot be done via API requests. For future tickets think about weight and count files in the backend and persist that information, so that there will be always a kind of report to ease the access and calculations.

34666466,2020-05-18 05:35:48.059,Backend: Improve Experiment's lifecycle,"### Problem to Solve

Right now the Experiments have an UUID and a nullable PipelineInfo.
The frontend wants to use a ""number"", this exists currently within the PipelineInfo.

IF an Experiment gets created *and* started, an Experiment has a PipelineInfo with that number (locally unique per DataProject), but if it is just created, no such PipelineInfo and therefore number exist.

This could be strange in some situations, so it is still / again technical debt:

### Technical Solution
* Add another number, which is scoped in MLReef, does not depend on gitlab, and exists at the exactly same time, the experiment gets created
* add a constraint: experiment_number, data_project_id
* (and also for PipelineCOnfigs): pipeline_number, data_project_id

34556321,2020-05-14 13:00:14.820,Backend: Reset Password Process,"### Problem to Solve
In order to allow users to reset their passwords, we have to implement a reset-password process in the backend.

* Upon triggering the process, the User shall receive an email which contains a password reset link which contains some form of a one-time password reset token.
  * the token can only be used once
  * the token shall expire after 24 hours
  * the token shall expire immediately if a new token is issued
* After following this link they can enter their new password in the frontend.
* The frontend then sends the password, together with the token to the backend.
* The backend then:
  * validates the token 
  * saves the new password
  * expires the token
  * performs a login for the user
  * returns the Session token to the frontend, so the frontend can ""also login"" the user


Part of this ticket is also documenting and communicating this process sufficiently with the frontend developer who implements #500 

### Technical Solution
The current design requires two backend endpoints.
1. For the frontend to trigger the process
2. For the frontend to set the new password

For the publishing process we need to store base environments in the backend, to create some new docker containers on top of them.

Right now we think we need to store at least:
* docker_image: String ""image:version""
* unique_slug: String ""PYTHON_2-6-GPU""
* name: String ""Python 2.6 Cuda GPU""
* description: String ""This package is nice an nice python 2.6 installed"" (can be used for description, requirements.txt, packages, and maybe python_version)

34268039,2020-05-07 14:16:45.089,EPF: Define Useful DataTypes for Application,"### Problem to Solve

Currently we have just a pile of quick-and-dirty created DataTypes as for a first draft

We need the some DataTypes, which can be used by EPF, Backend and Frontend.

Now we planned them as single words, but of course we could design them as slug+name,
e.g. ""image"" and ""Image"" is quite the same for single words.
""satellite-data"" and ""Satellite Data"" may differ, but is easy to calculate the relation between slug <-> name

### Technical Solution

Data Types suggested

The data types can be grouped in these classes:
- Tabular: csv files, numerical, categorical, usually each row represents a sample, each column the features.
- Time series: csv files in which each row has time information , the rows are ordered usually by time. In this case (medical signals, economic indicators, prices of goods, trajectory of a car...)
- Images: the images(png,bmp, jpg..) usually come in folders with the class name, or a csv files with images in string form.
- Voice:  Recordings mp3, wav, usually come in folders with the class name.
- Video:  Recording  wmv, mp4, mkv, usually come in folders with the class name.
- Hierarchical (optional it can be considered a subcategory of tabular): Json files that represent data and its hierarchy, usually can be considered as tabular data. for example, positional data, landmarks for face recognition, tags of objects inside an image.. etc.

Output data types 
- model : model saved as a binary file.
- All the input datatypes apply here as well.",1

* [x] ""published_at"": Timestamp? 
* [x] ""entrypoint"":String (with file ending implicitly)
* [x] ""base_environment"" either as slug which refers to the enum class
* [x] ""accepted_at"" and ""accepted_by"" as time and String/ or Subject_id

Additional Notes
=====================

* Support a base environment text id (""slug"") in the backend for DataProcessor
* Add entrypoint/command string path to Dataprocessor
* A dataProcessor Dto has a ""is_published"" flag(available via MarketplaceEntry Link)
* backend: accepted_at, or accepted_by as fields for legal reasons AND version of publishing terms",4

* some quality measuresments can be required: 
  * name and description set
  * input and output dataType defined
* a MarketplaceEntry is created

Think how the annotations and paramters will be translated and saved into backend, possible another endpoint triggered by EPF

### Technical Solution

* [ ] endpoint with minimum input: global_slug, predefined Tags

We decided that estimation is just for the minimal part, as we dont now anything about EPF

The GitLab API currently does not allow to upload images. The cause of the bug is not obvious since the documentation is really poor about this functionality, it just hints that multiple formats are accepted.

Sometimes, the deploy script fails for temporary reasons. E.g: the docker registry timed out. If this happens after _Step 2_ (Gitlab port configuration). The script cannot just be restarted.


### Technical Solution
There are different solutions possible. Either ""surgically"" remove configurations which can lead to the script failing on a second run (e.g. Gitlab's `external_url`)

or

Add additional `if` or `goto` statements which cover for a Gitlab that has already been configured

In the future, we want to get rid of those permanent tokens and use either the backend's Gitlab Admin Token for almost all requests.

If necessary the User's OAUTH-token can also be used 


### Technical Solution
* [ ]  Remove the permanent API tokens from the Data Model

During Login the MLReef backend currently responds with the _permanent token_ **AND** _OAUTH token_.

Technically, the OUATH token is issued by Gitlab after the Backend requests it.

31200244,2020-02-24 12:00:38.479,Create experiment UUID,"### Problem to Solve

Currently, in the experiment detail view, the experiment ID is the experiment name. We need to change this to be a true UUID, which is also stored in our backend DB (@flohin). 



### Technical Solution

As we are currently working with branches (an experiment creates a branch where it stores the output files), we could use the UUID created by the Gitlab for branches - if Gitlab does that?

We need an forking project view, as the forking progress might take some time. There are some ""specialities"" for this view: 

1.  There is a gif ;) 
2.  The top area needs to be hidden away (the grey area contracts and only shows what is included in the screen), because: 
3.  We need to automatically refresh the page to see if the project has been completely forked. Gitlab refreshes every 2 seconds or so.

Use the liniar indeterminate progress bar from material ui as progress bar: https://material-ui.com/components/progress/

THe pipeline experiment can be canlled through Gitlab, but then backend is out-of-date. So after receiving the successful response then the backend has to be updated.

### Observed behaviour

In prod environment, the publishing button is clickable on not-owned code projects. Although it does not do anything, other than redirect the user to an empty screen, this button should show the forking modal.

### Problem to solve
**Data visualization overview**

- [x] The stile differs from datasets & visualization overview. Visualizations has all tabs (in progress, active, expired) while datasets has only the one with an entry. How we are doing it with datasets is much better imo.
- [x] The button view pipeline in visualization has no function. It should have the same style as in the data visualization detail view.
- [x] The button in view pipeline from dataset overview redirects to the data ops pipeline, but it doesnt reconstruct the pipeline. This works when you enter the dataset detail view. Could you adapt this to work on all cases?
- [x] Remove the ""Use"" and ""Expires in"" fields from data visualizations.
- [x] The active icon in visualization is wrong (exclamation mark) compared to checks (see dataset).
- [x] Remove the pre-fix ""data-visualization/"" of the data visualization name.
- [x] The username is not clickable.
- [x] The delete function is not working (no modal to delete the data visualization, as in datasets).
- [x] We should rename the ""expired"" tab to ""failed"" and ""canceled"". We should rename the ""active"" to ""success"". In both data visualization and dataset view.
- [x] I noticed that the active data visualization in your repo ""well-megalodon"" has status failed but is in the ""active"" section. This should be then in the new ""failed"" section.

**Data visualization detail view**

- [x] The status should have color (e.g. failed in red, pending in orange, success in green, canceled in red).
- [x] @andres46 implemented in the experiment view (executive summary) that I could click the ""files selected from path"" (src) whick links to the commit hash view of that path and the branch name, linking to the commit hash view of that branch. He knows more about this but we should include this function in both visualizations and dataset view. Not sure if there is a separate ticket for this, though?
- [x] The data visualization uses (e.g. t-sne) should be clickable and link to the code repo (in a new tab). This for both data viz and dataset.
- [x] The abort button is always active, despite the datavisualization being finished. It should be replaced by an X (delete). This deletes the entry and the corresponding branch.

### Problem to solve
<!--
  Describe the desired state of the system in the style of:
  “As a (User / Manager / Admin / Guest) I want to be able to do x”
--> 
As a developer, I want it to be really easy to create additional end-to-end tests. For almost all tests it is necessary to be logged in and create at least one project.

Therefore, it makes sense to have something like a TestDirector which covers the following use cases.

- [ ] Creates user and logs in user if needed
- [ ] Creates a project which can then be used in the tests.

Additionally (for extra credit :smile: ) it might make sense we 
- [ ] let the TestDirector cache User and/or Project info so that we are creating as few new users as possible.

### Problem to solve
<!--
  Describe the desired state of the system in the style of:
  “As a (User / Manager / Admin / Guest) I want to be able to do x”
--> 
Currently, we have [one end2end test which publishes a code ](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/blob/master/web/src/__end2end-tests__/CodePublishing.test.jsx), **BUT** it never asserts that a Docker Image was actually put into the docker registry.

The target of this ticket is to add ""an assertion"" to the test which queries Gitlab's API for information about the Docker registry and asserts that the newly created Image was uploaded.

The process in the backend works as follows:
* backend receives publish request at `api/v1/projects/{id}/publish`
  * creates Dockerfile in repository
  * create `.mlreef.yml` in the repository
* Gitlab starts a pipeline based on the `.mlreef.yml` 
  - [ ] Test needs to assert that a pipeline was started
  - [ ] Test needs to wait until the pipeline is finished
* The pipeline builds the docker image and pushes it to the built-in docker registry
  - [ ] Test needs to assert that a new image is present


### Proposal for Technical Solution

### Problem to solve
Context: To make builds faster and more efficient, Gitlab allows adding conditionals to build scripts. So e.g. the frontend build and FE unit tests are only executed if frontend code has been changed.

e.g:
```
only:
  changes:
    - web/**/*
```

Currently, the end2end tests are located under `web/src/__end2end-tests__` and unfortunately, this means, whenever an end2end test is edited or added we have to wait for the frontend build (and deploy) to be finished.

So the topic of this ticket is to move the end2end sources out of `web/src/` so that we can use a Gitlab ci build filter on the `web/src` folder.



### Proposal for Technical Solution
Proposal: Refactor end2end test source to e.g. `web/test/__end2end-tests__` and `web/tests/__unit-tests__`

### Observed behaviour

The current function of uploading folders has several issues and need to be adapted to files upload: 

- [x] Drag and dropping a file into the drop field results in an error (it does simply not work). 
- [x] When opening the explorer view (by clicking on the drop field), the explorer want to find folders. We need to change this so the explorer searches for files to upload. Selecting multiple files (not only limted to one) should be possible. 
- [x] There seems to be a cap in size to upload of 10MBs in total (sum of all files). This is a limit that is not realistic, as there are no datasets that are below 10MBs. We should have a limit for this of severl GBs (if we need a limit). 
- [x] The root where the user navigated before in the tree view of the repository should be kept for uploading files. So if he moved to cats/train and presses the + button to upload files, the newly uploaded files should be placed there. 
- [x] This root information should also be shown in the upload view (if design is required, please tell). 
- [ ] The drag-drop function removes previous files, review that



### Expected behaviour



### Steps to reproduce
In staging, try the upload folder function.

- [x] In the ticket https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/issues/683 some changes were requested for the ""Experiments Overview"". 
These changes have to be replicated wherever the data sets and pipelines information is presented.
- [x] In the dataset details, the breadcrumb does not work.
- [x] Make the abort button work for the data set details view. The button is shown sometimes when it makes no sense because the pipeline was already canceled or finished by itsel - the abort button is shown in the detail view all the time. It should be replaced by an ""X"" if the job is somehow complete and the entry can be deleted.
- [x] Data visualizations overview and data visualization details view have to look like data sets and data sets details view
- [ ] Counter of data visualizations in the repo overview and number of data visualization entries in data visualizations overview do not match
- [x] hide datavisualization prefix ""data-visualization/"" - so show only the name
- [ ] Change the format of the time stamp for all pipelines :) currently -15102020-1 to **- 15/10 14:30:01** 
- [x] Can we include the weight of the branch in the ""use: "" section? Does gitlab provide this info? If not, lets delete this sections.
- [x] The view pipeline button has no function

### Observed behavior
As a user I want to have inmediate feedback as soon as I created any pipeline and I executed it (by pressing the ""proceed to results"" button in the modal view""). Today, and most of the times, a toaster appears with e.g. ""experiment created"" but no entry is found in the experiment overview. This is the same for all other pipelines. 

Then, after a while a new toaster appears with pipeline was created and then, the entry is available. 

This time difference results in confusion and bad UX.


### Expected behaviour

The entry should be created immediately. The pipeline can start afterwards if the machines are not available yet. 

### Steps to reproduce

In staging, execute any pipeline and jump directly to the results. No entry is there until, if it goes fast, a few seconds but sometimes it takes minutes! 

### Solution
In order for the backend to create a pipeline in Gitlab, some steps have to be performed
* [PipelineServiceL209](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/mlreef/-/blob/master/backend/mlreef-rest/src/main/kotlin/com/mlreef/rest/feature/pipeline/PipelineService.kt#L209) and following

One step is to look for or create the EPFBot user. -> Searching is done by select all users from Gitlab and iterating through them. --> `AuthService.CreateOrFindGitlabUser()` --> AuthServiceL263.

`AuthService.CreateOrFindGitlabUser()` is the first place to be changed to a more scalable approach.

We believe, optimising this function will solve the performance problem.

First approach to try out -> https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/search.html#scope-users

### Problem to solve

Implement the user flow of the publishing wizard, the wireframes are ready and HTML elements will be done soon. 

Use these elements to create the UI from the ""Select entry point view"" to the interlude. This will be the first stage, it encompasses to provide all the files and data necessary to publish the code project and persist it in the database, call the API's and show the interlude view.

In the next link, the prototype can be found. For this issue *only* the slides 1-4 are required.

### Proposal for Technical Solution
These are the technical requirements for this stage: 

* Select entry point:

1. Publish one branch at the time which will be the master branch (protected branch from gitlab) as a starting phase. The commit hash is NECESSARY as well.
1. The entry point is the file or script to run in python.
1. The purpose of the publication process is to publish a data operator.

note: Requirement.txt should be placed in the root, and we try to find it there. Should not be picked by the user, validated in this stage.

* Select base environment:

1. Can only select one environment, only some that are very useful will be as options for the moment.
1. We need from backend the list of environments available, and an endpoint to send the environment selected(to be called after the publish button is pressed)

* Publish model:

1. Clarify the model type, whether more options should be shown or not.
1. An endpoint to list the model-types
1. An endpoint to list ml categories
1. The model type and ML categories selected should be a field in the backend and included in the publish endpoint
1. Boolean to persist whether the user accepted the terms of publication, manage versions(probably a timestamp).

### Problem to solve

The frontend developers will develop the publishing wizard with the mockups/wireframes.

During that development, we might find out the logical point when the frontend wants to send data to the backend (start the wizard) and what information the frontend sends and expects from the backend.

Due to missing planning, we dont know that yet in the backend. Therefore we want to try the upstream design approach: 

**-> Frontend tells Backend how the endpoint should be like, and backend follows that proposal.**

### Proposal for Technical Solution

we might need several endpoints:

* starting the publishing (backend checks project and request for validity)
  > the first iteration is very basic still. When An existing ""unpublished"" Data Repo is published, the following things will happen
   - [x] A `Dockerfile` is added to the project&#39;s Git Repo
   - Does the Dockerfile need to be customized?
   - [x] A `.mlreef.yml` is added to the Git Repo
   - does the `.mlreef.yml` has to be customized?
   - push the docker image as `:latest` version to the docker registry
   - [x] Gitlab triggers a pipeline based on the `.mlreef.yml` for every commit on the ""master"" branch
   - [x] this pipeline creates a new version of the Docker image
   - [x] pipeline is tested in end2end tests? --> based on !806

70331274,2020-08-26 16:29:14.161,Add systemTest for Publishing Docker Images to Gitlab/MLReef infrastructure,"[MLReef&#39;s Glossary](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/www-mlreef-com/-/tree/master/handbook/glossary.md)

### Problem to solve
The most basic part of publishing user-generated Data Processors within MLReef is building and pushing 
Docker Images to MLReef&#39;s Gitlab based Docker Registry.

It might be necessary to activate or configure the Docker Registry -> https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#enable-the-container-registry

There exists already a [test project on gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/mlreef/devops/develop-data-processor) which can be cloned and then pushed to the relevant branch environment or other infrastructure.

### Todo

* call the API codeProject
* checkout codeProject
* add some mlreef.yml manually to the project
* push it
* test it? 
  * does a pipeline run?
  * does it succeed?
  * API call to check docker registry if something is there?

### User experience goal
MLReef Developers can manually define a Dockerfile and mlreef.yml file to build and push docker images to the MLReef Docker registry.


### Proposal for Technical Solution
The smallest and simplest possible Dockerfile as a reference to `alpine:latest` without further modifications
```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
```

The corresponding `.mlreef.yml` would look something like this:
```yaml
build:
  image: docker:19.03.5
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script: |
    echo ""$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD"" | docker login ""$CI_REGISTRY"" --username=""$CI_REGISTRY_USER"" --password-stdin
    docker build --tag ""$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"" -f Dockerfile .
    docker push ""$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG""
```

69896496,2020-08-17 08:54:57.687,Re-run a pipeline the same way it was initially executed,"### Problem to Solve
As a user I want to simply re-run a past experiment, dataops pipeline or data visualization. This is done by clicking on a ""view pipeline"" button in the resulting experiment / dataset / datavisualization which brings me back to the pipeline view, with **all** parameters set as they initially was. This includes: 

- Data path from data selector selected and pointing to the state of the data as it was (commit history)
- All data operators are opened with the hyperparameter values set as they were
- The data operators' script needs to be the same as it originally was. This might be more tricky, as we somehow would need to store the version of the script used. In relation to our publishing process and the docker images, this might be a challenge...


### Technical Solution
Q: How do we solve the script versioning in relation to the publishing process?

**Detailed implementation: **

The commit id should be received in the view in order to rebuild the same project files structure when the data operation was executed. This involves only the file selector, the Gitlab API request should send the commit id as the ref, and then the user will see everything as it was then.

As a user I want to be able to easily track what version of files I used for any of our pipelines. For example, in the experiment executive summary view this is done by clicking on the data links (see additional notes).

### Technical Solution
Use GIT (commit history) to track the data used:

MLReef Pipeline -> Gitlab Pipeline -> Commit Hash

For example: 
""master"" should link to ""185b6788dd948bc9c93be5ee01081dd3640eec30 on master""

IDK if our frontend can handle this already but in Gitlab it would bring you to the state of the repo at this exact commit.

69396825,2020-08-04 07:28:19.589,Backend: Protect data from inconsistency by creating constraints in DB,"### Problem to Solve

As we have many methods like ""findByGitlabId"" or ""findBySlug"", we have soft business requirements that some entity fields are unique or ""kind of"" unique. There was an error, when gitlabId was used twice and everything broke down due to our security mechanisms.

Therefore we could do two things:
* replace those soft ""unique""s with lists
* harden and use constraints

We have very weak constraints relations in Postgres. Sometimes we got inconsistency state in db that requires manual fix by developers. 


### Technical Solution
1) Create constraints in database
2) Check the code and possible add business logic that rejects inconsistent data before it has gone to database
3) if some ""soft constraints"" are not hard enough to be ""unique"", those methods must change to support lists!


### Terminology

Currently we do not have a really good integration testing concept. Though not the main focus of this ticket, it makes sense to think about a sustainable test concept as well.

Some of the needed tests are:
* start a model training 
* upload training statistics to the Backend
* upload trained model results
* start data pipeline and verify results
* cancel experiment


## Additional Notes
There currently exist some bash and curl based tests which could be extended and adapted, but dont seem to run on each machine.
There exists also an existing integration test concept, which spins up a gitlab machine and has a clean, reproducible state to run tests. Integration tests can be run on each machine which could start the server, as they rely on docker and kotlin. There are already many integration tests for various reasons which tests different strategies and can be debugged, this concept seems better in terms of maintainability, system architecture and matches the rest of the technology.

On Linux and OSX these existing curl-bash-scripts tests already work pretty ok but @si-ge-st had problems running them on Windows.",15

“As a user i will choose the data input using the Data Selector, this path should be the value for the hyperparameter input-path”

Set the value of the hyperparameter called ""input-path"" with the Path from Data Selector. This hyperparameter can be overwritten by simply writing another input path over the ""standard"" value from the data selector.

For this, we need to: 
- [ ] Limit the number of selections a user can do in the data selector to 1 (either a folder or file)
- [ ] Redisign the data operators cards to include the automatic input-path from the data selector

### Technical Solution
Probably, the input-path field needs some automatic updating. For example, if I start by dragging data operators in the pipeline and then select data from the data selector, the input-path field needs to be automatically updated.

A better pattern for routes handling was found by Saathvik. It makes sense to apply it and refactor the router component in order to improve the readability of that code.

To apply this pattern in the routes file, an array of objects would probably be better. The object needs a field to indicate that the route is private or not. 
```
{""projectName"": { ""isPrivate"": true, pattern: 'my-projects/project-slug/some-sort-of-name/param/:some-param' }}

- [x] In the experiment detail view, the success status is red. It should be green on success, oragne on pending, green on running and red on failed or aborted. 
> please I need the step to reproduce it

**Open develop / open resnet50 project / go to experiments / open running experiment (holy-siren) / in the details tab the ""running"" is red**

- [x] In the market place, when more than 3 projects appear, the filter and the new ML project buttons are separated. They should stay on the same when more projects are added.

@andres46 I think we already had the form for creating a new group, didnt we?

41162369,2020-06-10 16:59:21.108,Extra parameters and fields required for data pipelines,"### Problem to Solve
A data processing pipeline currently provides the following information:
![pipeline](/uploads/257372836cc04f6b9b164fd3dbad3514/pipeline.PNG)

Some additional information that is necessary from backend:
1. The corresponding gitlab pipeline information (as we have with experiments).
This will allow getting information such as **pipeline status**, **pipeline creation, updation times** and **duration**
of pipeline etc....

### Technical Solution
The required information is available for the frontend

after mlreef#526 and backend!72 it is necessary to clean up technical debt
Problem: right now we use the user as GIT_PUSH_USER and GIT_PUSH_TOKEN, which is a security leak.
We already have te mechanism to create an ""EPF-Bot"" user, but now this was created for the user's group, and is a Maintainer, which is equally insecure as using the user, and even worse, is not really connected to project.

So actually we need to solve many problems:
* when creating a user, a user group must be created. *This group must be used as the owner* for every new project.
* For every dataproject of this group, a specific EPF-Bot can be created, for example ""mlreef-project-$UUID-$ID-bot"" for a data/code project with UUID $UUID and the connected gitlabId $ID.
* when a pipeline is started (before the gitlab pipeline call takes place), the following must be ensured:
  * the project EPF-Bot exists and has a token
  * that token can be stored as GIT_PUSH_TOKEN for that project (once per project is enough, no need for every CI)
  * that epf-bot username can be stored as GIT_PUSH_USER for that project 
  * the custom EPF_URL (to update/finish the experiment/pipeline) is created for this distinct PipelineInstance, therefore it shall exist as a pipeline-scoped CI variable and must not exist as a project-scoped CI variable

**Final Notice**: Right now we have the user as the owner of its resources. But actually we need to have the user's group to be the owner, to allow to add the epf-bot as a group member of that project (with DEVELOPER roles, should be sufficient). As a hack, we could add the epf-bot as a free floating user and just assign to that project. Maybe that is even easier, as we dont need the group-
