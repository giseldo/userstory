This will save both yourself and us some time. If you're sure there isn't
another issue, continue through the template below. All the text between
the opening and closing arrows (HTML comments) will not be shown in the end
result.

## Platform
<!-- When possible, please provide what version you're running. -->

* Operating System: Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon
* Browser: Firefox 76.0



## What is happening and/or broken?
<!-- Provide as many details as you can and if possible a little step-by-step
guide so that we can reproduce the issue. Screenshots or a video that shows the
problem also help immensely. -->
I tried to change my password using an automatically-generated password from Bitwarden. I was shocked to receive the message that this password had been pwned. When I checked on https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords, though, it said this password has not been found in any breaches.

Here it is:

## What is expected to happen?
<!-- Explain what the expected result is if it's not clear from how it is
broken. You can omit this if the expected result is just ""It should work"" or
similar. -->
Either give a message saying symbols are required or something, or allow me to use it if it's a valid password.",1
31854870,2020-03-11 05:33:02.409,tag autocompletion doesn't work for the second tag if you type a space between the tags,"To reproduce:
* start creating a new topic
* enter the first characters of a tag in the tag box
* use autocomplete to finish
* type a space
* type the first letters of a tag

The cause wasn't apparent at first. I must have been typing a space out of habit.",2
30698882,2020-02-13 04:17:59.888,Un-pin and upgrade Salt in Vagrantfile,"As described in [the message for the commit where I pinned the version](https://gitlab.com/tildes/tildes/-/commit/4dc99d9fda4b3282d7dc00a65e5196d8fc95b66e), a new version of Salt has been released but is currently buggy and breaks creating a Tildes dev environment since it can't handle `unless` checks.

I've pinned Salt to the previous stable version for now, so this is just a reminder that it would probably be good to un-pin and upgrade eventually once the bugs are worked out.",2
29924702,2020-01-24 18:50:14.177,Add a “Post a new topic” button into the sidebar on the group search result page,"<p>
My current workflow when posting topics to groups always starts with
searching if the link I am about to submit has already been submitted.
E.g. I search withing ~music for the artist or the song name.  But after
that, I have to either push “Back”, or navigate to the group page again,
as the “~music” in the page header “Search in ~music: Foo My Bar
Tonight” is not a link back to ~music (an issue of its own).  I would
prefer if there was a “Post a new topic” button in the side-bar of the
group search results.

And now that double quotes have actual meaning because of the search upgrades that came with Postgresql 12, when doing a quoted search it looks a little weird:

![image](/uploads/ccb287d7b40b64448d8b1d9edd847914/image.png)

See e.g. <a href=""https://tildes.net/~comp/igx/fortnightly_programming_q_a_thread#comment-42sg"">this comment</a>.  In
the black theme, both <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> have the
<code>background-color</code> of <code>#222</code>, which means that
there is no distinction between the quote text and the code or
preformatted text within this quote.  I think that <code>#444</code>
would be a good colour for code inside quotes in the black theme, not
sure about the rest.

This will require some significant updates to the code, so I've pinned it to 2.x for now but should try to do these updates before too long, since 3.0 seems to have quite a few benefits.

23816183,2019-08-15 19:04:39.564,"Add a ""demo"" page for themes","It would be really nice to have a page where people can easily flip through all the themes and see what different site elements look like with them applied. It could have various ""fake"" site elements, like what a topic in listings looks like, a little fake comment tree showing how the different types of comments (e.g. exemplary, new) look, and so on, so you can get an overview of the theme in one spot.

This should be fairly straightforward to implement - have a view that creates a `Topic` object, some `Comments` objects and so on (and don't add them to the database session), and then use them all in the template macros that are used to render real versions of those objects. That way the page will keep itself updated whenever any designs change, since it's using exactly the same macros and methods as other pages.",2
23722124,2019-08-13 03:40:22.009,Change comment voting so it doesn't replace the entire comment,"Now that we have `<details>` blocks in comments, there can be some strange behavior when voting on a comment that contains them. Since voting results in the entire comment being replaced by intercooler, any `<details>` blocks in it end up getting reset back to their default expanded/collapsed state.

It should be totally fine to just replace the vote button instead of the entire comment. I think originally I was replacing the entire comment because the vote count was inside it, but since it's in the button now there's not really any need to be replacing the whole comment any more.",2
