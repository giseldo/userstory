<--------------------->
Additional information:

This is the glaxnimate-git package on Arch Linux. 
I have seen the same issue with the glaxnimate package. 
This issue is also present on every lottie file I have tried to import. 
Saving the file to disk and then importing it has the same results.

I don't have other operating systems to try on, so I don't know if it's related to my OS, some version of a package in my OS or anything. 
A few months ago Arch moved away from python2, and it's now depreciated, with python3 taking it's place. These two are not exactly compatible, so if you are using python scripts to handle the import this may be where the issue lies.",2

Please see this [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/RVVwrAaY-XU) I recorded for explaining the following issues:

## If Font Size > 49

### Steps to reproduce (1)
* Open Glaxnimate
* Add a Text Line with `Font Size > 49`

#### Result
The `Text Box` would become a small icon and may reside at the top-left corner of the screen

***
## Change the Font Size < 50 and see the Anchor Point
### Steps to reproduce (2)
* Keep it selected and change the `Font Size < 50`

#### Result
* The Text Box will return to its normal shape.
* Observe the `Anchor Point` may not be at the center of the Text Box, it might be at the top-left corner of the Screen or the Text box itself.
* Click anywhere on the screen to deselect it and then select it back, but `Anchor Point` would not be at the center point of the Text Box.

***
## If Font Size < 50, See Anchor Point.
### Steps to reproduce (3)
* Add another Text Line with `Text Size < 49`

#### Result
* Observe that Text Box would appear fine, however, its `Anchor Point` would reside on the top-left corner of the screen.
* Click anywhere on the screen to deselect it. Now select it back and you would observe that the `Anchor Point` jumps back to the center of the Text Box.

#### Version

git master as of May 3, 2022.

#### More Info

`M_PI` is not in any C or C++ standard. It is commonly available, however:
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Mathematical-Constants.html

That indirectly explains you need to define `_XOPEN_SOURCE` with gcc (and clang?). MSVC probably requires a different macro, but you might not be experiencing the problem there. In any case, I can workaround the problem by setting environment variable `CXXFLAGS-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500` before the first run of cmake, which I will do as a workaround for now. (Edit `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` in `CMakeCache.txt` if you already ran cmake.) In my own code for these circumstances I put into a header file before `#include <math.h>` (or `<cmath>`?)
```
#if !defined(_XOPEN_SOURCE) || _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500
#  undef _XOPEN_SOURCE
#  define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500
#endif
```

In the original Glax format and json, the jam is hidden by putting it's alpha channel to 0. It is changed abruptly to 1 at the moment the bread reach the center of the picture. It use the ability to keep a state constant until a keyframe and then change it progressively, or change abruptly it's state.

[murphy_anim0.json](/uploads/fd7f15b5513c41b76cf3a68f7795d2b3/murphy_anim0.json)

With SVG conversion instead, the change from 0 to 1 is progressive, making the jam fade-in before the bread slice cover it.

[murphy_anim0.animated.svgz](/uploads/e12d9e1bcf7cb06728cdfc80adf0ed6f/murphy_anim0.animated.svgz)

An easy solution for the animator would be to have the jam object follow the bread, hidden behind it. But for conversion, a new nod near the changing state node could keep the 0 value to emulate Lottie feature.
